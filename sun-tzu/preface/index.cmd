In the preface, \sun-tzu tells us that
mathematics governs absolutely everything,
and allows us to do even magical things
like "seek .[the] whereabouts of gods .[and] earth gods".
Basically it reads like advertising material for
prospective STEM undergraduates.

  which it is parallel with.

  Probably the four cardinal directions
  plus the four intercardinal directions.
  Sometimes called the "principal winds" in English.

====
* 沖：童也； children

  Those who wish to learn it must seek to
  gauge .[one's] abilities .[and] measure oneself,

====
* 量： gauge; or measure \+
  量，去聲， \C l(oe)ng6, \M li(a\)ng \+

  When it is the verb "measure/gauge" applied to physical measurements
    (e.g.~volume of grain),
    it is read in 平聲 (l(oe)ng4/li(a/)ng),
  but when applied to figurative or not-so-physical quantities
    (e.g.~量力, "gauging strength/ability", or 量入, "gauging revenue"),
    it is read in 去聲 (l(oe)ng6/li(a\)ng).
