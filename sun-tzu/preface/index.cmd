In the preface, \sun-tzu tells us that
mathematics governs absolutely everything,
and allows us to do even magical things
like "acquire .[the] whereabouts of gods .[and] earth-spirits".
Basically it reads like advertising material for
prospective STEM undergraduates.

====
* 量： measure; \or gauge \+
  量，去聲， \C l(oe)ng6, \M li(a\)ng \+
  量 is a funny word.
  When it is the verb "measure/gauge" applied to physical measurements
    (e.g.~volume of grain),
    it is read in 平聲 (l(oe)ng4/li(a/)ng),
  but when applied to figurative or not-so-physical quantities
    (e.g.~量力, "gauging strength/ability", or 量入, "gauging revenue"),
    it is read in 去聲 (l(oe)ng6/li(a\)ng).
  And when it is the noun "amount",
    also 去聲 (l(oe)ng6/li(a\)ng).
