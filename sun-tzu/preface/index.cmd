In the preface, \sun-tzu tells us that
mathematics governs absolutely everything,
and allows us to do even magical things
like "seek .[the] whereabouts of gods .[and] earth gods".
Basically it reads like advertising material for
prospective STEM undergraduates.

<<
  孫子曰：夫算者，
||
  \sun-tzu saith: Computation---
>>
====
* 算：
    Computation;
    \or Mathematics

====

<<
  天地之經緯，群生之元首；
||
  .[the] warp .[and] woof of Heaven .[and] Earth,
  .[and the] origin .[and] beginning of amassed life;
>>
====
* From this line until almost the end of the preface,
  the text consists of pairs of lines which parallel each other,
  character for character.
  This is a very common rhetorical device in Literary Chinese.

* 經緯： .[the] warp .[and] woof; \or .[the] meridians .[and] parallels \+
  ["Warp and woof"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/warp_and_woof)
  is a good translation, both literally (longways and sideways threads)
  and figuratively (fundamental structure).
====

<<
  五常之本末，陰陽之父母；
||
  .[the] beginning .[and] end of .[the] Five Everlasting .[Virtues],
  .[and the] father .[and] mother of Yin .[and] Yang;

>>
====
* 三光： .[the] Three Luminaries \+
  [日月星](https://ctext.org/three-character-classic#n90576),
  i.e.~the sun, the moon and the stars.

* \c[52056] erroneously has 裹 for 裏.
====

<<
  五行之準平，四時之終始；
||
  .[the] evenness .[and] balance of .[the] Five Elements,
  .[and the] finishing .[and] starting of .[the] Four Seasons;
>>
====
* 五行： .[the] Five Elements \+
  [金木水火土](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Xing),
  i.e.~metal, tree, water, fire and earth.
  Perhaps better rendered as ".[the] Five Phases".

* 準：平也；又均也； evenness; \or levelness

* 群： amassed; \lit crowded

* 倫： kinds; \or types

* 二氣： .[the] Two Forces; \lit .[the] Two Breaths \+
  陰氣, "Yin Force", and 陽氣, "Yang Force".
  Recall 陰 and 陽 are
  "Dark .[and] Light", "Shade .[and] Sun", or "Female .[and] Male".
  [氣](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi)
  is usually rendered as "life force",
  romanised as Hei ([Cantonese](/cantonese/conway-romanisation)),
  Ch'i (Wade--Giles) or Q(i\) (Pinyin).

* 從橫： meridians .[and] parallels (of latitude) \+
  Variant of 縱橫.
  Here 從橫 is referring to "things of broad scope"
  or "the grand scheme of things", in contrast to 精微
  (intricacies .[and] minutiae) in the previous line,
  which it is parallel with.

* 長短： length; \lit length .[and] shortness
====

<<
  采神祇之所在，極成敗之符驗； \+
  窮道德之理，究性命之情。

  .[it] seeketh .[the] whereabouts of gods .[and] earth gods,

* 規矩： .[the] rules; \lit the compass .[and] the set square

* 尺丈： .[the] rule .[and the] rod \+
  Units of length, see [Vol.~I \P1] ["i 1"].
  One rule, chih ((尺)), is of the order one Imperial foot,
  and one rod, chang ((丈)), is equal to ten rules.
====

<<
  立權衡，平重輕， \+
  剖毫釐，析黍絫。
||
  establisheth the weighing scale,
  balanceth heavy .[and] light \+
  disecteth mils .[and] cents,
  .[and] splitteth millets .[and] piles.
>>
====
* 重輕： heavy .[and] light; \or important .[and] unimportant

* 毫釐： mils .[and] cents \+
  Small units of length (see [Vol.~I \P1] ["i 1"]),
  respectively a thousandth and a hundredth
  of the Chinese inch, ts'un ((寸)).

* 黍絫： millets .[and] piles \+
  Small units of weight (see [Vol.~I \P2] ["i 2"]),
  respectively a hundredth and a tenth

====

<<
  歷億載而不朽，施八極而無疆。
||
  .[It] endureth .[an] hundred million years and decayeth not,
  .[and is] applied unto .[the] Eight Extremities without bound.
>>
====
* 億： .[an] hundred million; \lit .[a] square-myriad

* 八極： .[the] Eight Extremities \+
  Probably the four cardinal directions
  plus the four intercardinal directions.
  Sometimes called the "principal winds" in English.
====

<<
  散之不可勝究，斂之不盈掌握。
||
  Scattering it, .[it] cannot .[be] wholly investigated,
  .[yet] gathering it, .[it is] not beyond grasp.

  勝，平聲， \C [^sh]ing1 (\pm [_s]ing1), \M sh(e-)ng (\gr sh(e\)ng)

* 斂：聚也； gathering

* 盈：過曰盈； beyond; \lit in excess of
====

<<

    .[shall find it] hard to .[be] proficient .[in it].
>>
====
* 沖：童也； children

* 皓：光也；白也； bright white \+
  皓，音號， \C hou6, \M h(a\)o

* Here the parallel pairing of lines stops.
====


<<
  夫欲學之者必務量能揆己，志在所專。
||
  Those who wish to learn it must seek to
  gauge .[one's] abilities .[and] measure oneself,
  .[and put one's] will into that focused upon.
>>
====
* 量： gauge; or measure \+
  量，去聲， \C l(oe)ng6, \M li(a\)ng \+
  量 is a funny word.
  When it is the verb "measure/gauge" applied to physical measurements
    (e.g.~volume of grain),
    it is read in 平聲 (l(oe)ng4/li(a/)ng),
  but when applied to figurative or not-so-physical quantities
    (e.g.~量力, "gauging strength/ability", or 量入, "gauging revenue"),
    it is read in 去聲 (l(oe)ng6/li(a\)ng).
  And when it is the noun "amount",
    also 去聲 (l(oe)ng6/li(a\)ng).
