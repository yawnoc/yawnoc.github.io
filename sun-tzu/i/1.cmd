  Ts'un ((寸)), the [__Chinese inch__] [寸].
  Of the same order of magnitude as the imperial inch,
  and used figuratively as the inch is in English
  to denote a small distance,
  so I am happy to simply render it as "inch".

* 尺： rule; \or ruler; \or covid \+
  Ch'ih ((尺)), ten Chinese inches.
  This is of the order one foot,
  but I have not rendered this as "foot"
  because there is no such connotation.
  Some translate this as "cubit",
  but a cubit is more like one and a half feet, or even two.
  The term "covid" appears to have been used in colonial Hong Kong,
  but I can't seem to find much about it on the internet...
  thanks a lot, WHO.

* 丈： rod; \or staff; \or measure \+
  Chang ((丈)), ten rules.
  Difficult to render because Chinese dictionaries
  simply define it as ten rules.
  More generally its meanings are "elder male",
  from the interchangeable 杖 or "walking stick",
  and "to measure/survey land".
  I have chosen "rod" for its few letters \& monosyllabicity,
  and because of the [imperial rod],
  of the same order of magnitude and also related to surveying.
  Also Moses had one.

  Tuan ((端)), fifty rules.

  P'i ((匹)), forty rules.
  This is the only unit rendering which I am unsatisfied with.
  匹 is the classifier for cloth, 一匹布 being "one length of cloth".

  Two hundred .[and] forty paces make one acre.

* 畝： acre; \lit field \+
  Mu ((畝)), 240~square paces.
  Classical Chinese mathematics did not have
  a fully developed notion of dimensional analysis,
  so 'square paces' were simply referred to as 'paces'.
  While a mu ((畝)) is only about a fifth of an [imperial acre],
  I have chosen to render it acre
  because both have the etymological meaning "field".

I can't be bothered looking up a reputable source
for the precise length of a ch'ih ((尺)) or rule
when \sun-tzu's Computational Classic was first written,
but using 0.3~metres as an estimate,
we have:
----
$$
  \begin{alignedat}{3}
    1 \unit{floss~(忽)} &={} & 10^{-6} & \unit{rules} && \sim 0.3 \unit{μm} \\

Silk is around 12~μm in thickness ([UAF], [Luong~_et~al._~(2014)][Luong])
so hu ((忽)), "floss", is much too thin,
and ss(uu) ((絲)), "(silk) thread", still a little thin.
Thus 蠶吐絲為忽, ".[the] silk spat of the silkworm be floss",
is an exaggeration of the thinness of silk.
But my job is only to translate the text as it is, not to correct it.

By the later part of the Ts'ing Dynasty,
one ch'ih ((尺)) or rule is 14⅝~inches in Hong Kong,
locally called a ch'ek ((尺)).
Reading through historical versions of the [Weights and Measures Ordinance]
enacted by the British in Hong Kong,
[Ordinance No.~22 of~1844 (PDF)] [ord 22 of 1844]
gives the following conversions between Chinese length units
(consistent with those above):

However, it is very interesting to note that
the British only standardised these
Chinese length units with reference to English units
in [Ordinance No.~8 of~1885 (PDF)] [ord 8 of 1885],
more than four decades later:

      and each inch into ten Fan or tenths. \

Eventually the ch'ek ((尺)) is given
the equivalent definition of 0.371475~metres,
used unto this day in Hong Kong;
see [Cap.~68 Weights and Measures Ordinance] [cap 68].
(Floor plans are reckoned in imperial feet though, written "呎".)

Taiwan uses a ch'ih ((尺)) from the Japanese occupation
equal to 10/33 of a metre, i.e.~0.3030...~metres,
and Mainland China uses a metric-based ch'ih ((尺))
equal to 1/3 of a metre, i.e.~0.3333...~metres.
In either case, ugh to recurring decimals.
