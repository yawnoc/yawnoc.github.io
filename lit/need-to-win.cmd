----
This alleged quote of Chuang Tz(uu)
begins the chapter "Family" in Tim Winton's '''The~Turning''':
----

""""
||||||{.centred-block .poetic}
||||
  When an archer is shooting for nothing \+
  He has all his skill \+
  If he shoots for a brass buckle \+
  He is already nervous \+
  If he shoots for a prize of gold \+
  He goes blind \+
  Or sees two targets--- \+
  He is out of his mind! \+
   \+
  His skill has not changed. But the prize \+
  Divides him. He cares. \+
  He thinks more of winning \+
  Than of shooting--- \+
  And the need to win \+
  Drains him of power. \+
||||
||||||

""""


----
The passage above, entitled "The Need to Win",
is from [Thomas Merton]'s '''The Way of Chuang Tzu''',
which in Merton's own words, consists of
"imitations" or "free interpretative readings" of the source material,
rather than translations.
Merton, a Trappist monk interested in Eastern religions,
composed these interpretative readings after comparing
"four of the best translations of '''Chuang Tz(uu)'''
into western languages, two English, one French, and one German".

----
The actual source of the passage is a dialogue between
Confucius and one of his disciples in 《莊子\.外篇\.達生》,
or "Understanding Life" in the "Outer Texts" of '''Chuang Tz(uu)''',
a work traditionally credited to [Chuang Tz(uu)][莊子] the Taoist philosopher.
One of the English translations of this which Merton read
was of course that of the great James Legge;
see passage~4, "Yen Yuan asked _K_ung-nî..." on
[Page~15 of '''The Sacred Books Of China: The Texts Of Taoism, Part~II'''][
  Legge Yen Yuan asked
]
As we shall see below, whether the original text actually refers to archery
depends on how you interpret the word 注, chu.

----
In summary, the passage above is  **twice removed from the source material**:
once through translation (by James Legge and others),
and once through the interpretative reading of Thomas Merton.
Just reading '''The~Turning''' though, you wouldn't have any clue of this.

  In any case, 注 certainly has the primary meaning of "wager".
  The archery meaning is not definitive in my opinion,
  so I have designated ".[by archery]" as translator-supplied.
  The conciseness of Literary Chinese comes at the cost of ambiguity;
  the same is also true of scripture.
  Many scholars have written 註, annotations,
  and 疏, subcommentary, or annotations of the annotations.
  And now, annotations of annotations of annotations...
