This "quote" of Chuang Tz(uu)
begins the chapter "Family" in Tim Winton's _The~Turning_:
----

""""
||||||{.centred-block .poetic}
||||
  When an archer is shooting for nothing \+
  He has all his skill \+
  If he shoots for a brass buckle \+
  He is already nervous \+
  If he shoots for a prize of gold \+
  He goes blind \+
  Or sees two targets--- \+
  He is out of his mind! \+
   \+
  His skill has not changed. But the prize \+
  Divides him. He cares. \+
  He thinks more of winning \+
  Than of shooting--- \+
  And the need to win \+
  Drains him of power. \+

The passage above, entitled "The Need to Win",
is from [Thomas Merton]'s _The Way of Chuang Tzu_,
which in Merton's own words, consists of
"imitations" or "free interpretative readings" of the source material,
rather than translations.
Merton, a Trappist monk interested in Eastern religions,
composed these interpretative readings after comparing
"four of the best translations of _Chuang Tz(uu)_
into western languages, two English, one French, and one German".

----
The source of the passage is a dialogue between
Confucius and one of his disciples in 《莊子\.外篇\.達生》,
or "Understanding Life" in the "Outer Texts" of _Chuang Tz(uu)_,
a work traditionally credited to [Chuang Tz(uu)][莊子] the Taoist philosopher.
One of the English translations of this which Merton read
was of course that of the great James Legge;
see passage~4, "Yen Yuan asked _K_ung-nî..." on
[Page~15 of _The Sacred Books Of China: The Texts Of Taoism, Part~II_][
  Legge Yen Yuan asked
]
As we shall see below, whether the original text actually refers to archery
depends on how you interpret the word 注, chu.

In summary, the passage above is  **twice removed from the source material**:
once by translation (James Legge and others), and once through the
interpretative reading of Thomas Merton.
Just reading _The~Turning_ though, you wouldn't have any clue of this.

  Alternatively, opinion might not be divided
  if 擊 (strike or hit) refers to striking or hitting with an arrow.
  ----
  ----
  In any case, 注 certainly has the primary meaning of "wager".
  The archery meaning is not definitive in my opinion,
  so I have decided to render 注 as "wagereth .[by archery]"
  with translator-supplied italics for the archery bit.
  ----
  ----
  The conciseness of Literary Chinese comes with a great cost:
  no one can really be sure of the author's intended meaning.
  (Such is also true of scripture.)
  Many scholars have written 註, annotations,
  and 疏, further-commentary, or annotations of the annotations.
  And now I am writing annotations of annotations of annotations...
