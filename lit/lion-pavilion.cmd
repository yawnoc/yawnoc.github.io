This is a semi-literary text on a plaque in the Lion's Pavilion,
[Victoria Peak], Hong~Kong.
Unfortunately I did not photograph the left half of the plaque.
From memory it contained a list of names of contributors to the funding
(referred to in the text as 諸君子, "all .[the] gentlemen"),
but no mention of the author.

  Victoria Peak, .[in] antiquity referred to .[as]
  .[the] Peak of the Great Sea-Turtle,
  overlooketh southward .[the] great sea,
  .[and] distantly looketh northward at each other

  These are 金木水火土,
  i.e.~Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, and Saturn respectively.

* 拱，拱翊，環衛也： going round \+
  The line 如北辰居中，而五星拱之 is a nod to Confucius
  in [《論語\.為政》](https://ctext.org/analects/wei-zheng):
  <<
    子曰：為政以德，譬如北辰，居其所而眾星共之。
  ||
    .[The] Master saith,
    .[He who] governeth by virtue,
    .[is] likened unto .[the] North Star, abiding in its place with
    .[the] multitude of stars going round it.

  Here, 共 is interchangeable with 拱.

====
* 百强： Pak-k'eung \+
  The name of the architect.
  According to [a separate plaque]
  his full name is Ch'an Pak-k'eung ((陳百强)).
  I have no idea why he is referred to by first name only.
  Note that he shares the same full name with [Danny Chan] (1958--1993).

* 則師： architect \+
  The use of 則 to mean architectural drawing, as in 圖則,
  appears to be local to Hong Kong.
  And in this context it is pronounced tsik7, not tsak7,
  although I have yet to come across a dictionary which
  lists this pronunciation.
