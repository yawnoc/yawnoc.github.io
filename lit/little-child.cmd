----
This is one of several accounts of [Hiang T'o ((項橐))][項橐],
a child prodigy who is supposed to have outwitted Confucius
at the age of seven.
From 《淮南子\.脩務訓》： [「夫項託七歲為孔子師」][脩務訓],
"Hiang T'o ((項橐)) .[at] seven years became teacher of Confucius".
In 《三字經》 he is mentioned in the line [「昔仲尼，師項橐」][三字經],
"Chung-ni ((仲尼)) of old, .[had] teacher Hiang T'o ((項橐))".

The Chinese source text is from a 1999 (己卯年) Chinese almanac (通勝),
printed by 天寶樓 (though these days only two almanac printing houses
remain in Hong Kong, 永經堂 and 廣經堂).
It is entitled 小兒論, with the heading 孔子問答 in the margins.
----

----
Although there is no paragraphing, k(u") tou ((句讀))
are supplied (albeit with errors in a few places).
These are the rudimentary punctuation markers
----
====
* k(u") ((句)), "。", for the end of a sentence, and
* tou ((讀)), "、", for a mid-sentence pause. \+
  讀，去聲， \C tau6, \M d(o\)u.
====
----
The almanac's usage of these is quite bizarre.
K(u") ((句)) are used even for mid-sentence pauses,
and tou ((讀)) are only very sparingly used for lists;
see [the actual first page of the almanac text][almanac text].

  The compound 名字 only means "name" in modern Mandarin;
  classically it refers to
  the two separate names 名 (birth name) and 字 (style name).

* 敎： .[a] teaching \+
  Arguably ".[a] religion" would also work.

  一日率諸弟子，御車出遊，路逢數兒嬉戲，中有一兒不戲。
||
  One day .[he] led .[his] many disciples,
  driving .[his] chariot out .[for] travel.
  .[Along the] road .[they] encountered several children playing,
  .[and] amidst .[them] there was one child .[who] played not.
>>
====
* 御：使馬也； driving \+
  Driving horses of course.

* 車： chariot \+
  車，音居， \C k\_(u")1, \M j(u-) \+
  This is a literary text, and Confucius~\&~co. are riding in a chariot,
  not a small cart or a wheelbarrow.
  Therefore, please do not pronounce this ch'e1/ch(e-);
  my ears will bleed.
====

<<
  孔子乃駐車問曰：獨汝不戲，何也？
||
  Confucius thus stopped .[his] chariot .[and] asked,
  saying,
    Alone thou playest not: why?
>>
====
* 駐：馬止也；
  stopped \+
  Literally "stopping .[the] horses".

<<
  小兒答曰：\
    凢戲無益，衣破難縫。上辱父母，下及門中。必有鬥爭，勞而無功。\
    豈爲好事？故乃不戲。
||
  .[The] little child replied, saying,
    All play .[is of] no benefit: clothes damaged .[are] hard to mend;
    .[an] insult .[to] father .[and] mother above:
    .[even] down unto .[those] amidst .[the] family;
    surely there .[shall] be fighting .[and] disputes:
    toil, but no achievement.
    How be .[this a] good thing? Therefore .[I] play not.

====
* 凢 \+
  Variant of 凡.

* 縫： mend; \lit stitch

* 門中：門，家門； .[those] amidst .[the] family \+
  His siblings.

* 功： achievement; \or (good) result

* 豈： how \+
  A very stern and righteous "how".

  .[He] then lowered .[his] head .[and began] building .[a] wall
  using .[some] tile pieces.
>>
====
* 低頭： lowered .[his] head \+
  Being a little child, he had to look up to speak to Confucius;
  having finished speaking he turned his head back down.
  From the [illustration][almanac text] in the almanac, he then
  joins in with the building of the wall:

* 片： pieces; \lit slices

<<
  孔子責之曰：何不避車乎？

  Confucius rebuked him, saying,
    Wherefore avoidest .[thou] not .[my] chariot?
>>

<<
  小兒答曰：自古及今，爲當車避于城，不當城避於車。
||
  .[The] little child replied, saying,
    Since antiquity, .[even] until now,
    be .[it that] the chariot ought to avoid the wall,
    not .[that] the wall ought to avoid the chariot.
>>
====
* 當： ought to; \or should
====

<<
  孔子乃勒車論道，下車而問焉：汝年尚幼，何多詐乎？
||
  Confucius thus restrained .[his] chariot
  .[to] reason, alighting .[his] chariot and asking,
    Thy years .[be] yet young; wherefore .[so] much cunning?
>>
====
* 論道： reason; \lit debate logic \+
  Maybe "argue for .[the right of] way".

* 詐： cunning; \lit trickery; \or deception \+
  Here I think Confucius is referring to the child's wit;
  I don't see how the child is tricking or deceiving Confucius in any way.
====

<<
  小兒答曰：\
    人生三歲，分別父母。\
    兔生三日，走地畎畝。\
    魚生三日，遊於江湖。\
    天生自然，豈謂詐乎？
||
  .[The] little child replied, saying,
    .[I the] human lived three years,
    .[and was] separated from .[my] father .[and] mother;
    the rabbit liveth three days,
    .[and] runneth upon .[the] ditches .[and] fields of .[the] earth;
    the fish liveth three days,
    .[and] journeyeth unto .[the] rivers .[and] lakes.
    Naturally .[are they] automatically thus: how be .[this] cunning?
>>
====
* 人生： .[I the] human lived \+
  Literally this is "human life", or "life".
  To match the pattern in the sentences which follow,
  人生三歲 might be rendered "man liveth three years".

* 三歲： three years; \or to .[the] age of three

* 畎：田中溝也； ditch (in a field) \+
  畎，音犬， \C h(u")n2, \M qu(av)n

* 天生： naturally; \lit born of nature; \or born of Heaven

* 豈謂： how be .[this]; \lit how speak of .[this as]
====

<<
  孔子曰：汝居何鄉、何里、何姓、何名、何字？
||
  Confucius said,
    Dwellest thou in what hometown, .[and] what village;
    .[and] what surname, what name, .[and] what style name .[hast thou]?
>>

<<
  小兒答曰：吾居敝鄉、賤地、姓項、名橐、未有字也。
||
  .[The] little child replied, saying,
    I dwell in .[a] shabby hometown, .[and a] lowly village,
    .[and am] surnamed Hiang ((項)),
    .[and] named T'o ((橐)),
    .[and am] yet to have .[a] style name.
>>
====
* 敝： shabby; \or worn-out \+
  Both 敝 and 賤 can be used
  as a self-deprecating substitute for "I" or "my".
====

<<
  孔子曰：吾欲共汝同遊，汝意下如何？
||
  Confucius said,
    I wish to travel together with thee:
    what .[be] thy thoughts .[upon this]?
>>
====
* **{.danger} Beware stranger danger. **

* 汝意下如何：
    what .[be] thy thoughts .[upon this];
    \or [what sayest thou](https://youtu.be/f_4-rCROcsM "What say you?")
====

<<
  小兒答曰：家有嚴父，須當事之。家有慈母，須當養之。
||
  .[The] little child replied, saying,
    .[In mine] house there is .[my] strict father: .[I] must attend to him.
    .[In mine] house there is .[my] loving mother: .[I] must provide for her.
>>
====
* 慈： loving; \or kind \+
  The quintessential father is strict (嚴) in that
  in addition to providing for his children,
  he ought not to fail in teaching them
  (as in [養不教，父之過][養不教],
  ".[to] provide for .[but] not teach, .[is the] mistake of .[the] father").
  The quintessential mother is kind/loving (慈).
  In literary Chinese the words 嚴 and 慈 can, even on their own,
  mean father and mother respectively.

* 養： provide for; \or support; \or feed

  .[In mine] house there is .[my] brilliant teacher:
    .[I] must learn from him.

* 賢： worthy; also virtuous \+
  Often used as an honorific.

* 順： obey; \or go along with; \or follow

* 明：高明； brilliant; \or wise

* 暇：閒也； spare time; \or free time

  孔子曰：吾車中有三十二棋子，與汝奕博，汝意下如何？

  Confucius said,
    In my chariot there are thirty-two chess pieces,
    .[to] play chess .[for a] wager with thee:
    what .[be] thy thoughts .[upon this]?
>>
====
* 三十二棋子 \+
  It is a coincidence that
  [Chinese Chess (象棋)][象棋] and [Western Chess][Chess]
  both use 16 chess pieces per player.
  Of course this text is not canon, nor is it historically accurate;
  in Confucius's time, 奕 referred to the [Surrounding Game (圍棋)][圍棋],
  more commonly known as Go.

* 天子： .[the] Son of Heaven \+
  The emperor.

* 理： administered; \or managed

* 侯： lords; \or marquesses \+
  See [諸侯](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%AB%B8%E4%BE%AF).

* 妨： harm; \or obstruct

* 士儒： scholars .[and] academics \+
  Both 士 and 儒 refer to scholars,
  although 儒 can mean Confucian scholar specifically.
  I have used "academics" to avoid rendering 士儒 as
  "scholars .[and] scholars".

* 學問： scholarship; \or learning; \lit learning .[and] enquiry

* 弛：放也，棄也，廢也； abandoned; \lit slackened

>>
====
* 小人： the little man; \or the despicable man \+
  In Confucianism, 小人 is a person of low moral character,
  always seeking quick personal gain.
  The opposite of 小人 is 君子 (gentleman),
  a refined man and a person of virtue.
  James Legge renders 君子 as "the superior man"
  and 小人 as "the mean man" in [《論語\.述而》](

  Confucius said,
    I wish to level out .[all] under Heaven with thee:

====
* 平却： level out; \or flatten away \+
  Alternatively, 平 may mean "make fair",
  as in fairness, and egalitarianism.

* 天下： .[all] under Heaven \+
  The whole world. Similar to "under the sun" in English,
  from the Hebrew
    <span lang="he" dir="rtl" class="no-wrapping">תחת השמש</span>,
  in [Ecclesiastes](https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3101.htm).

====
* 螢火： firefly light \+
  This riddle only works because 火 may mean both "fire" and "light".

* 土山： the dirt hill; \or the earth hill \+
  Similarly this works because 山 may mean both "mountain" and "hill".

* 仙人： the celestial man \+
  A supernatural, immortal being, usually celibate.
  Many people attempted to become immortal by
  ingesting various "immortality elixirs" of [alchemy],
  which were usually [toxic substances].

  (Presumably "months" are 28-day months,
  so that ten months make forty weeks, a full term.)
  Being a physicist, I take a very dim view of such works

    Father .[and] mother are .[more] close .[unto their children];

  .[The] little child replied, saying,
    .[A] man losing .[his] wife .[in] life,
    .[is] like .[a] chariot losing .[its] wheel.
    .[Should a] wheel .[be] lost, remake .[it]:

  賢家之女，必配貴夫。十間之室，須得棟樑。

  .[A] daughter of .[a] worthy family,

======
* 貴： worthy; \or honourable; \lit noble \+
  Perhaps "venerable" as in "commanding respect"
  would also work, but 貴 has no connotation with age.
  Rendering both 賢 and 貴 as "worthy" is not desirable,
  but unavoidable.

* I have rendered 十間之室，須得棟樑
  literally, but really this is saying
  ".[the] women of many families must get upholding .[men]":

  * 十間： many families; \lit ten partitions \+
    間，去聲， \C kaan3, \M ji(a\)n
  
  * 室： women; \lit bedchambers \+
    In other contexts, 室 may mean wife or concubine.
  
  * 棟樑： upholding .[men]; \lit pillars .[and] roof beams \+
    Those worthy of bearing great responsibility.

======
* 後生可畏！焉知來者之不如今也？ \+
  This is part of an actual (as in canon) quote of Confucius
  in [《論語\.子罕》](https://ctext.org/analects/zi-han#n1331):
  <<
    子曰：\
      後生可畏，焉知來者之不如今也？\
      四十、五十而無聞焉，斯亦不足畏也已。
  ||
    .[The] Master said,
      The young ought to .[be] feared;
      .[for] how know .[we] .[that] those who come .[after us],
      .[be] not as .[we who are] now?
      .[By] forty .[or] fifty and .[be they] unheard of,
      then .[be they] not worthy of fear.
  >>
  ====
  * 後生： the young; \lit the after-born \+
    This constrasts with 先生, literally "former-born",
    which classically was a polite address to an older, wiser person.
    This usage survives today in Cantonese,
    and also Japanese _sensei_, where 先生 means teacher.
  
  * 畏： feared; \or respected \+
    Here, I do not mean fear as in being afraid,
    but rather reverence and respect, as in fearing God.
    ".[Is] formidable" is also a good rendering of 可畏,
    but the following 不足畏 then becomes difficult to render likewise.
  
  * 不如： not as; \or not .[as good] as

  The almanac erroneously has 焉能求者 for 焉知來者;
  this is called 執錯字粒, or
  "picking .[the] wrong character block" in printing.
