Recently I was re-enjoying John Green's <cite>CrashCourse World History</cite>.
</p>
<p>
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylWORyToTo4&amp;t=3m55s">3:55 of the episode on Chinese history and the Mandate of Heaven</a>,
he says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="書經">Shujing</span> is pretty specific
about what caused the <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="夏">Xia</span> kings to lose the Mandate, by the way, explaining,
"<mark>The attack on <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="夏">Xia</span> may be traced to the orgies in <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="鳴條">Ming Tiao</span></mark>."
</p>
<p>
Sadly the <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="書經">Shujing</span> is woefully short on details of these orgies,
but orgies are the kind of behavior that is not expected of a ruler,
and therefore Heaven saw fit to come in, remove the Mandate,
and allow the <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="商">Shang</span> to take power.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This got me intrigued: what is the original Chinese term
that has been rendered as "orgies"?
</p>
<h2 id="translation"><a href="#translation" class="permalink" aria-label="Permalink"></a>Translation</h2>
<p>
The relevant snippet of the <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="書經">Shu King</span>
is from <span lang="zh-Hant">《伊訓》</span>, "Instructions of <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="伊">Yee</span>".
The Chinese source text below is from Chinese Text Project,
but with olden-style punctuation:

<p>
As can be seen, there is no mention of orgies in the original text.
So where has John Green gotten them from?

<h3 id="legge-1879"><a href="#legge-1879" class="permalink" aria-label="Permalink"></a>Legge (1879)</h3>
<p>
The translation quoted by John Green ultimately appears to come from
James Legge's <cite>The Sacred Books of China: The Texts of Confucianism, Part I</cite>,
the earliest edition of which I could find is
<a href="https://archive.org/details/wg903/page/n6/mode/1up">1879 (Oxford at the Clarendon Press)</a>.
</p>
<p>
On <a href="https://archive.org/details/wg903/page/93/mode/1up">Page 93</a>, the snippet is rendered thus:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
But their descendant did not follow (their example),
and great Heaven sent down calamities,
employing the agency of our (ruler)
who was in possession of its favouring appointment.*
<mark>The attack (on <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="夏">Hsiâ</span>)
may be traced to (the orgies in) <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="鳴條">Ming-thiâo</span><sup>1</sup>,
but our (rise) began in <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="亳">Po</span></mark>.
</p>
<footer>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="鳴條">Ming-thiâo</span> was a place not far from the capital of <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="桀"><i>K</i>ieh</span>
(in the present district of <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="安邑">An-yî</span>, <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="解州">Hâi <i>K</i>âu</span>, <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="山西">Shan-hsî</span>).
He had a palace there, where the vilest orgies were celebrated
that alienated the minds of the people from him.
</p>
</footer>
</blockquote>
<p>
Notice how "the orgies in" is in parentheses.
<strong>This is because "orgies" is a translator-supplied word;
it does <em>not</em> appear in the original text.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, there are newer books
that reproduce Legge's translation with the parentheses removed.
For example, Andrea and Overfield's
<cite>The Human Record: Sources of Global History, Volume I</cite> (Eighth Edition)
has the following on Page 31 through 32:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
But their descendant did not follow their example,
and great Heaven sent down calamities,
employing the agency of our ruler<sup>2</sup>
who was in possession of its favoring appointment.
The attack on <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="夏">Xia</span>
may be traced to the orgies in <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="鳴條">Ming Tiao</span>.<sup>3</sup>
</p>
<footer>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="成湯">Zheng Tang</span>, founder of the <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="商">Shang</span> Dynasty,
who was supposedly enthroned in 1766 B.C.E.
</p>
<p>
<sup>2</sup> <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="成湯">Zheng Tang</span> (see note 1).
</p>
<p>
<sup>3</sup> According to legend, <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="桀">Jie</span>, the last <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="夏">Xia</span> king,
held notorious orgies at <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="鳴條">Ming Tiao</span>.
</p>
</footer>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, what has likely happened, is that John Green and his writers
have based their script on one of these newer, unparenthesised versions
of the Legge (1879) translation, and in doing so,
lost the translator-supplied nature of the word "orgies".
</p>
<h3 id="legge-1865"><a href="#legge-1865" class="permalink" aria-label="Permalink"></a>Legge (1865)</h3>
<p>
The above 1879 translation is not Legge's first rendering of the <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="書經">Shu King</span>.
<cite>The Chinese Classics, Volume III, Part I</cite>, published in
<a href="https://archive.org/details/wg903/page/n6/mode/1up">1865 (Hongkong: Printed at the London Missionary Society's Printing Office)</a>,
is an earlier work that translates "the first parts of the <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="書經">Shoo-King</span>"
among other texts.
</p>
<p>
On <a href="https://archive.org/details/chineseclassics31legg/page/194/mode/1up">Page 194 (within portion II)</a>,
there is the following rendering with extensive commentary:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p lang="zh-Hant">
于其子孫弗率、皇天降災、假手于我有命、<mark>造攻自鳴條</mark>、朕哉自亳。
</p>
<p>
But their descendant did not follow <i>their example</i>,
and great Heaven sent down calamities,
employing the agency of our <i>ruler</i>,
who had <i>received</i> its favouring appointment.
<mark>The attack <i>on <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="夏">Hea</span></i>
may be traced to <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="鳴條">Ming-tʻëaou</span>,
and our <i>attack on it</i> began in <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="亳">Pŏ</span></mark>.
</p>
<footer>
<p>
<span lang="zh-Hant">于其子孫</span>,—by <span lang="zh-Hant">子孫</span> <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="桀">Këĕ</span> is pre-eminently intended.
Perhaps <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="伊">E</span> had other earlier and unworthy sovereigns in his mind as well,
but <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="桀">Këĕ</span> was the impersonation of all the wickedness of <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="夏">Hea</span>.
<span lang="zh-Hant">于</span>='in the case of.'
</p>
<p>
<span lang="zh-Hant">皇天降災</span>,—<span class="romanised-untranslated" title="林之奇">Lin Che-kʻe</span> illustrates this by saying that
'the spirits of the hills and rivers could no longer be in tranquillity.
Hills fell; rivers were dried up; strange sounds were emitted.
Birds and beasts, fishes and tortoises, no longer followed their nature,
and many of them were changed into monstrous and prodigious things.'
I quote this, as showing how the Chinese share in the feeling of a sympathy
between the course of nature and the character and doings of men,
so that 'the whole creatiou groans' and writhes
to be delivered from the curse of human wickedness.
<span lang="zh-Hant">假手于我有命</span>,—'borrowed a hand from our having the appointment.'
<span class="romanised-untranslated" title="林之奇">Lin Che-kʻe</span> expands the clause well.
<span lang="zh-Hant">假手于我商有天命之成湯,使之伐夏救民,以爲天吏.</span>
</p>
<p>
[Up to this point the paragraph is found, but in a very different form,
in the only remaining part of <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="墨子">Mih-tsze</span>'s Book on <span lang="zh-Hant">鬼(明鬼篇,下)</span>.
He gives it as from the 'Books of <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="商">Shang</span>:'—<span lang="zh-Hant">嗚呼,古者有夏,方未有禍之時,百獸貞蟲,允及飛鳥,莫不比方,矧在人面,胡敢異心,山川鬼神亦莫敢不𡨴,若能共允任,天下之合下土之葆</span>.
<span class="romanised-untranslated" title="墨">Mih</span>'s text is evidently corrupt;
yet he could hardly have the 'Instructions of <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="伊">E</span>,' as we now read them.]
</p>
<p>
<span lang="zh-Hant">造攻</span>,<span lang="zh-Hant">云云</span>,—compare <a href="https://ctext.org/mengzi/wan-zhang-i#n1740">Mencius, V., Pt. I., vii. 9</a>.
There we have 'the palace of <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="牧">Muh</span>' (<span lang="zh-Hant">牧宮</span>) instead of <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="鳴條">Ming-tʻeaou</span>.
But from the <a href="https://archive.org/details/chineseclassics31legg/page/4/mode/1up">Preface, par. 12</a>, we know that <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="鳴條">Ming-tʻeaou</span>
was not far from the cap. of <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="桀">Këĕ</span>.
<mark>It was there probably that he had the palace of <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="牧">Muh</span>,
where his orgies alienated the people from him,
and awoke the vengeance of Heaven.</mark>
[There was another <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="鳴條">Ming-tʻeaou</span> towards the east,
where <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="舜">Shun</span> died, according to <a href="https://ctext.org/mengzi/li-lou-ii#n1700">Mencius, IV., Pt. II, i, 1</a>.]
'Out attack commenced (<span lang="zh-Hant">哉</span>=<span lang="zh-Hant">始</span>) in <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="亳">Pŏ</span>,'—the meaning is that the virtues of <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="湯">Tʻang</span>,
pleasing to both Heaven and men, first displayed in <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="亳">Pŏ</span>,
marked him out as the punisher of <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="桀">Këĕ</span>, and the successor to the empire.

<p>
In this 1865 rendering,
<strong>the word "orgies" doesn't even appear in the translator-supplied words</strong>
(which are printed in italics as per certain editions of the King James Bible).
Orgies only get mentioned in Legge's commentary.
</p>
<h3 id="discussion"><a href="#discussion" class="permalink" aria-label="Permalink"></a>Discussion</h3>
<p>
I have no doubt that James Legge's 1865 commentary
and subsequent 1879 supply of the word "orgies"
is well-informed by Chinese sources.
His <a href="https://archive.org/details/chineseclassics31legg/page/n226/mode/1up">list of works consulted</a> is extensive,
and I simply do not have the time to look through them all in search of orgies.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, there are other texts that attribute orgy-like behaviour
to <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="桀">Kiet</span>, the final king of <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="夏">Hia</span>.
For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://ctext.org/lie-nv-zhuan/xia-jie-mo-xi" lang="zh-Hant">《列女傳》</a> describes him as licentious with women,
filling his palace with them, and drinking alcohol with them day and night
without rest. It describes an incident where,
under the influence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Xi">the unvirtuous consort/concubine <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="末喜">Mot Hee</span></a>,
he constructs a pool of alcohol large enough to ferry a boat,
and makes three thousand men drink from it like cattle.
The men subsequently become drunk and drown, and <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="末喜">Mot Hee</span> laughs at them.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/博物志/卷之七" lang="zh-Hant">《博物志》</a> describes an incident
in which he constructs a "Long-Night Palace" in the midst of a deep valley,
where men and women mingle, and where he spends a hundred days
neglecting his duty to hear matters of state at the royal court.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
But the important point is that the original text of the <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="書經">Shu King</span>
makes no mention of such orgies.
</p>
<h2 id="summary"><a href="#summary" class="permalink" aria-label="Permalink"></a>Summary</h2>
<p>
To conclude,
when John Green says "The <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="書經">Shujing</span> is pretty specific"
in relation to orgies, he is incorrect.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand,
when he says "the <span class="romanised-untranslated" title="書經">Shujing</span> is woefully short on details of these orgies",
he is correct — but only because there is no mention of orgies at all.
