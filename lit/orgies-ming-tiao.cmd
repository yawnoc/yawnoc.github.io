At [3:55 of the episode on Chinese history and the Mandate of Heaven][episode],
he says:

The (Shujing|書經) is pretty specific
about what caused the (Xia|夏) kings to lose the Mandate, by the way, explaining,
"The attack on (Xia|夏) may be traced to the orgies in (Mingtiao|鳴條)."

Sadly the (Shujing|書經) is woefully short on details of these orgies,
but orgies are the kind of behavior that is not expected of a ruler,
and therefore Heaven saw fit to come in, remove the Mandate,
and allow the (Shang|商) to take power.

This got me intrigued: what is the word in the original Chinese
that has been rendered as "orgies"?
