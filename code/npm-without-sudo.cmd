# The Right Wayâ„¢ to do global npm install without sudo

--
[...]
--

## Step 1: Configure NPM

``
npm config set prefix ~/.local
``
--
Now NPM will install your global executables to `~/.local/bin`,
and the libraries to `~/.local/lib/node_modules/`
--

## Step 2: Add `~/.local/bin` to your path

PATH=~/.local/bin/:$PATH
``
