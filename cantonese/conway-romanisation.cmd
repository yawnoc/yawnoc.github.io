----
  Modern Cantonese has merged the initials in the pairs
    {將~[^ts](oe)ng vs 張~[^ch](oe)ng},
    {槍~[^ts'](oe)ng vs 昌~[^ch'](oe)ng} and
    {相~[^s](oe)ng vs 傷~[^sh](oe)ng}.
  As noted by [Samuel Wells Williams]
  in [《英華分韻撮要》][wells-tonic-dictionary] (1856, or 咸豐丙辰年):
----
""""
  The initials _ch_ and _ts_ are constantly confounded,
  and some persons are absolutely unable to detect the difference,
  more frequently calling the words under _ts_ as _ch_, than contrawise.
""""

----
The pre-merger distinctions are remnant only in most romanisations
of district names in Hong Kong, e.g.
----
====
* {[^ts]~vs~[^ch]}:
  將軍澳 ([^Ts]eung Kwan O) and 荔枝角 (Lai [^Ch]i Kok),

* {[^ts']~vs~[^ch']}:
  荃灣 ([^Ts]uen Wan) and 東涌 (Tung [^Ch]ung), and

* {[^s]~vs~[^sh]}:
  西灣河 ([^S]ai Wan Ho) and 筲箕灣 ([^Sh]au Kei Wan).

====
----
Not all district romanisations
follow the pre-merger consonants correctly though,
e.g.~灣仔 should really be Wan [^Ts]ai (not Wan [^Ch]ai),
and 彩虹 should be [^Ts]oi Hung (not [^Ch]oi Hung).
----

----
Now despite the merging of those pairs of initials,
I perceive a tendency for people to favour different consonants
of the merger depending on the vowel which follows:

----
The {[_s]~vs~[_sh]} tendency is the strongest.
I have *never* heard anyone pronounce 書, [^sh](u")~/~[[^ɕ]yː],
as [!s](u")~/~[[!s]yː] (which is both wrong and not favoured),
and yet the vast majority of people will pronounce 石, [^sh]ek~/~[[^ɕ]ɛːk̚],
as [_s]ek~/~[[_s]ɛːk̚] (which is wrong but favoured),
myself included.
The {[_ts]~vs~[_ch]} and {[_ts']~vs~[_ch']} tendencies are not as strong,
but still prevalent.
----

||||{.important}
I have decided for historical purposes
to preserve the pre-merger distinctions in my romanisation system,
using the [^pre-merger initial]
according to [《分韻撮要》](https://ytenx.org/pyonh/).
||||

||||{.important}
However, unless you want to sound really weird,
**I still suggest pronouncing words out loud
using the appropriate [_favoured post-merger initial]**
listed in the table above,
rather than the [^pre-merger initial].
For example, [_s]aang [_ch']oi rather than [^sh]aang [^ts']oi for 生菜.

If typesetting of the characters [.(oe).]~`U+0153`

you may use the ASCII-only substitutes [.oe.] and [.ue.] respectively.

----
Tone~4 is also pronounced slightly falling, i.e.~[fɐn˨˩]~(21),
especially if the syllable is drawn-out
(for instance in operatic or theatrical dialogue).
Tone~2 can start slightly lower, i.e.~[fɐn˨˥]~(25).
----

----
Cantonese preserves all ending consonants of Middle Chinese,
and thus there is a correspondence between
the nasals ([m], [n], [ŋ]) and the unreleased stops ([p̚], [t̚], [k̚])
of the entering tones (入聲).
Pronunciations in old rime dictionaries can only be understood
in terms of this correspondence:

----
While the entering tones (入聲) 7, 8, 9 are the same pitch
as tones 1, 3, 6 respectively, they should not be regarded as the same.
In poetry, balancing 平聲 (tones 1 and 4) and 仄聲 (the rest)
is highly desirable; if you count tone~7 (高陰入) as tone~1 (陰平),
you will get tone patterns (平仄) wrong.
None of Jyutping, Yale and Sidney~Lau make this distinction.
----

----
Tone patterns and literary situations aside though,
tones in colloquial Cantonese are highly versatile, in that they can be
vernacularised as different tones in particular instances.
This, in my opinion, makes colloquial Cantonese
probably the most inconsistent language in the world.
Here are a few examples:
