----
These days the Chinese Communist Party loves rambling on about
how there are "separatists" undermining One China.
"Who dares to even suggest dividing the Motherland into two?" they ask.
----

----
Well, as it turns out, none other than their beloved Mao Ts(e^)-tung,
in a 1920~essay for the newspaper _Ta Kung Pao_ (大公報).
Actually Mao went further and suggested dividing China up into 27~pieces,
one of them being the "Republic of Hunan", Hunan being his home province.
----

I have only been able to find two versions of this,
of which I shall be using the first version as the source text,
as the second appears to have many transcription errors:

----
To briefly contextualise, the year was 1920,
the ninth year of the proclaimed [Republic of China],
and the Communist Party would be founded in the year after.

Today, 99~years on, wake up and ask yourselves:
Who now is the imperialist and expansionist oppressor?
Who now is pushing Uyghurs and Tibetans towards death?
And who now forbids any mention of self-determination or independence?

  .[On the] first of September .[I] arrived at .[the] province;
  flipping through .[the] "Ta Kung Pao", .[its] cover .[was] struck .[in] Red,
  .[and] within .[it] there were many of my favourite discussions,

  I oppose .[a] 'Great Republic of China',
  [:.[and] I assert .[a] 'Republic of Hunan':].
  What reasons have .[I]?
>>

<<
  大概從前有一種謬論，就是「在今後世界能夠爭存的國家，必定是大國家」。
||
  Broadly, there is .[an] absurd discourse from former .[times],
  .[which] is: 'In .[the] world hereafter,
  .[the] nations .[which shall be] able to survive, must be Great Nations'.

<<
  最著的例，是英、美、德、法、俄、奧，他們幸都收了其實沒有成功的成功。

  .[The] most notable examples, are of
  Britain, America, Germany, France, Russia, .[and] Austria-.[Hungary]:
  they all .[have been] fortunate .[to] reap of success without actual success.

  還有一個就是中國，連「其實沒有成功的成功」，都沒收得，
||
  .[Yet] also there is one .[other], .[which] is China,
  .[for which], even 'success without actual success'
  .[they have] not even reaped:

<<
  收得的是滿洲人消滅，蒙人、回人、藏人、奄奄欲死，
||
  .[that] reaped is .[the] annihilation of .[the] Manchurians;
