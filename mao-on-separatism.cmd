I am not a lawyer,
but the Chinese Communist Party really doesn't like separatism.
"Who dares to even think about dividing the Motherland into two?" they ask.
--
--
Well, as it turns out, none other than their beloved (Mao Ts(e^)\-tung|毛澤東),
in a 1920~essay for the newspaper ''(Ta Kung Pao|大公報)''.
Actually (Mao|毛) went further and suggested dividing China up into 27~pieces,
one of them being the "Republic of (Hunan|湖南)",
(Hunan|湖南) being his home province.
--
--
I have only been able to find two versions of this,
of which I shall be using the first version as the source text,
as the second appears to have many transcription errors:

1. [Google books]
  --
  This is in
  ''Selected Historical Materials of .[the] (Hunan|湖南) Autonomy Movement''
  (::{l=zh-Hans} 《湖南自治运动史料选编》::) by (Li Tieming|李铁明),
  locatable by searching Google Books for
  `"湖南自治运动史料选编" "湖南建设问题的根本问题——湖南共和国"`
  (then scrolling back and forth until the pages are unblocked).
  --

2. [marxists.org] ([archived version])
  --
  This is taken from the 1968 (Wuhan|武漢) Version of
  ''Long Live (Mao Ts(e^)\-tung|毛澤東) Thought''
  (::{l=zh-Hans} 1968年武汉版《毛泽东思想万岁》::).
  --

To briefly contextualise, the year was 1920,
the ninth year of the proclaimed [Republic of China],
and the Communist Party would be founded in the year after.
(Mao|毛)'s essay criticises the imperialist notion of 'Great Nation'
that has resulted in the pillage of his country.
--
--
Today, 99~years on, wake up and ask yourselves:
Who now is the imperialist and expansionist oppressor?
Who now is pushing Uyghurs and Tibetans towards death?
And who now forbids any mention of self-determination or independence?
