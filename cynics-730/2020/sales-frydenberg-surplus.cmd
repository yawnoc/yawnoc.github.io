  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  The Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, is with me now from Canberra.
  --
  --{.interview-host}
  Treasurer, let me start with a question in your capacity,
  as a member of the National Security Committee of Cabinet:
  why is the current decision not to close Australia's borders
  or to cancel mass events?
  --

  ![Josh Frydenberg:]
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _Because the advice we've received says so._
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  The best possible medical advice to us is that
  [the existing] travel restrictions should stay in place
  but they shouldn't be extended to other countries,
  including to broader Europe.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  So we'll continue to take the best possible advice
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _and blame the advisors if necessary_.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  When it comes to mass gatherings, again,
  we take the advice of the chief medical officer [...].
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  Of course, states can take their own decisions
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _which I welcome, since *they* would then take the blame
  for any public-health or economy-related consequences
  associated with those decisions,
  instead of us,_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  but right now the advice is not to avoid those mass gatherings.
  --

  --{.interview-host}
  [...]
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Given how quickly this situation is evolving,
  is it possible that the stimulus package you've announced today
  could be the first of a number of them for the Australian economy?
  --

  ![Josh Frydenberg:]
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _I hope not,
  I would really like to see a surplus before the next election..._
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well this is a very substantial package [...]
  in response to a pretty significant economic impact.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  But of course, the budget is in eight weeks' time
  and the coronavirus is not going away,
  so we'll continue to do what is necessary
  to support the Australian economy.
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  You mentioned the budget,
  you've made these measures temporary so they're not baked into the budget,
  but isn't this a time to *use* the budget
  to also make some structural changes,
  for example bringing forward your planned income tax cuts
  across all brackets?
  --

  ![Josh Frydenberg:]
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _I'll take that as a compliment._
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well again, we've shown our mettle when it comes to reducing taxes.
  We've passed through the Parliament over $300~billion of tax cuts...
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  I didn't ask what you've done, I asked about what you might do.
  --

  ![Josh Frydenberg:]
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _I know, but free airtime for the Coalition & tax cuts..._
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  Yeah, but in terms of what we have announced today,
  there is [sic] substantial incentives through the tax system
  for businesses to invest,
  and that continues to be a priority for us.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...] the actual initiatives [for our stimulus package] are
  targeted, [...] temporary and [...] proportionate [...].
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  But that doesn't address my question which is,
  shouldn't the budget be used to make some structural changes
  that can help the country's fiscal position going forward?
  --

  ![Josh Frydenberg:]
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _The Coalition's tax cuts are good!_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well we continue to undertake structural reform
  and that includes our tax legislation that passed through the Parliament.
  But today's announcements had pretty substantial...
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  You're still not addressing, sorry Treasurer, what I'm asking.
  --

  ![Josh Frydenberg:]
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _Oh I don't know. Wait till the budget._
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well, in terms of what comes forward in the budget,
  you'll have to switch on in May for that outcome.
  [...]
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _The Coalition doesn't spend as much as Labor!_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  But Leigh, we have done the hard yards,
  over the last six and a half years
  to bring the budget back into balance,
  which has given us now the flexibility
  to use this financial firepower at a time when it's needed most.
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  You'll only be able to tell in hindsight if you've made the right decision
  about the size of today's stimulus package
  and the way the money is directed.
  --
  --{.interview-host}
  Will its success be judged on whether or not Australia avoids recession?
  --

  ![Josh Frydenberg:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...] what we'll see is $11~billion go into the economy
  before June the 30th [...].
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  But how do you judge the success of it, Treasurer?
  --

  ![Josh Frydenberg:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well, how I judge the success of it
  is that it supports the Australian economy,
  keeps people in a job
  and it keeps businesses in business [...].
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _In other words, if we do avoid recession,
  then I'll be judging it on the fact that we avoided recession,
  but if we don't avoid recession,
  then I won't be judging it on the fact that we didn't avoid recession._
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Last year you were claiming credit
  for a surplus that you'd not yet delivered,
  saying the budget was back in black.
  You were warned at the time
  that global events could derail that prospect,
  which they now have.
  --
  --{.interview-host}
  What does your premature rush to claim credit for a phantom surplus
  say about your political maturity and judgement?
  --
  --{.interview-host .thought}
  _There. Nailed him._
  --

  ![Josh Frydenberg:]
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _Ouch... Er, my premature rush did help us get re-elected,
  so I think it says good things
  about my political maturity and judgement?_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well, we took the best possible advice
  [...] based on the forecasts at the time [...]
  we've now taken these major spending decisions
  and the surplus won't arrive in '19/20
  as a result of some of these circumstances we've seen.
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  But Treasurer, you claimed credit
  for something that you hadn't yet delivered
  and I'm just wondering why you did that
  when at the time you were warned that events could derail it
  and they have?
  --

  ![Josh Frydenberg:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well, [...] we made our presentation
  based on the forecasts at the time,
  and clearly when it comes to
  the fires, [...] flood, [...] drought and [...] coronavirus,
  the economy has been hit by a number of external economic shocks
  that have been beyond our control.
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _My premature rush to take credit was also beyond my control._
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  When it comes to our response...
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  But, Treasurer, can I...
  --

  ![Josh Frydenberg:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  ... we can control that.
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Sorry to interrupt you there.
  --
  --{.interview-host}
  You say, you know, these external shocks,
  you couldn't have seen them coming.
  Treasury budget papers did warn about this kind of thing.
  --
  --{.interview-host}
  I want to play our audience something
  from around the time of the budget last year.
  --

  ![Josh Frydenberg:]
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _You're going to make me look like a proper dickhead now, right?_
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host .thought}
  _Yep._

    --{.interview-host}
    Like any projection,
    your ability to deliver that $7~billion surplus
    is reliant on factors that are outside your control;
    it might not happen?
    --

    ![Josh Frydenberg:][Josh Frydenberg 2019 7.30]
    --{.interview-guest}
    No, it *will* happen
    and it's the product of bringing the spending under control.

    There might be a collapse in China;
    there might be another terrible drought;
    then you might have to write down the NBN.
    Things can happen, that could prevent you actually achieving this.
