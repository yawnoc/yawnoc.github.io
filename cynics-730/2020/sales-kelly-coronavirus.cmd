  ![Leigh Sales:]

  You've said that most new cases
  are still coming into Australia from overseas.
  --
  --{.interview-host}
  There were some pretty [confronting scenes] today at Sydney Airport,
  where big crowds of people were arriving and going to be temperature tested
  in spaces where there was *clearly* insufficient room for
  any sort of social distancing.
  --
  --{.interview-host}
  How can a situation like that be allowed to happen?

  ![Paul Kelly:]
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _Incompetence?_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  A couple of things I'd say about that:
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  One is, that the numbers of people returning from overseas
  are decreasing quite rapidly.
  But there's still several thousand people every day.
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _Now, as intelligent a person as I am (a Professor at ANU),
  I shall pretend that your point is about the testing,
  and not the amount of space._
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  Uh... it's interesting that you would say that
  people were concerned about being held up for temperature testing.
  Of course, a few days ago we were being criticised
  for not testing enough at the airport.
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host .thought}
  _Christ, you sound like a politician.
  You're supposed to be a medical expert._
  --
  --{.interview-host}
  I'm not saying that they were concerned about that.
  --
  --{.interview-host}
  I'm saying that the concern was
  the amount of space that had been allocated.
  --
  --{.interview-host .thought}
  _Don't you have any shame?_
  --

  ![Paul Kelly:]
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _Apparently not. Let me ignore your question and change the topic._
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  Yeah, and that's one of the reasons why
  we've gone to the 14~days of self-isolation.
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _Verily, before 15~March,
    we travelled forward in time
    and saw today's packed queues at Sydney Airport,
  and this influenced our decision
  to extend the 14-day isolation requirement
  to *all* international arrivals from 15~March._
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  That means staying at home, umm, because...
  airports are not set up for this sort of thing
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _so it's the airport's fault, for being an incompetent airport_.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Can you explain to people watching tonight
  why the health body that advises the government
  is not opting for the extreme lockdown measures
  that are being used in the UK and in New Zealand?
  [...]
  --

  ![Paul Kelly:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  In terms of [...] should we go hard-and-fast
  or should we have a proportionate response
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _note how I use "proportion*ate*"
  rather than "proportion*al*",
  so as to imply, from the outset of my answer,
  that hard-and-fast is disproportion*ate*_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  that can be scaled over time, uh...
  there is a difference of opinion, I'll agree with that.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...] [COVID-19] is an infectious disease,
  it's transmitted from person to person,
  it's mostly when you're very close to another person,
  and you increase that by being in large crowds of people
  who may or may not have the infection
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _such as high-density queues for Centrelink
  or for temperature screening at Sydney Airport_.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Why was the half-hour advice given about hairdressers
  and then changed so soon after,
  how does that square with the assurance that
  all the restrictions follow expert medical advice?
  --

  ![Paul Kelly:]
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _Iunno._
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  In terms of hairdressers [...]
  it's impractical to keep the [...] 1.5~metres [...]
  but there are many other things that people can do [...].
  So minimising the time is one of them. [...]
  Second of all if you are sick, don't go and get your hair cut.
  If you are a sick hairdresser, don't go to work.
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  But you're not answering the actual question, which is regarding
  how the rule can be changed from one day to the next
  if the restrictions are based on the medical advice.
  --

  ![Paul Kelly:]
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _Incompetence?_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  Uh look, the advice we give goes to the Cabinet;
  the Cabinet have their discussions;
  I'm not privy to how those discussions went [...].
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  Things are changing every day here [...]
  and that was one of the things that was changed today.
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Dr~Kelly, thanks for your time.
  --

  ![Paul Kelly:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  You're welcome, Leigh.
