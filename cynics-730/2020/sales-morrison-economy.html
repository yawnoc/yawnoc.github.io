<div class="interview">
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Prime Minister, welcome to the program. Thank you for your time.
</p>
<img alt="Scott Morrison:" src="scott-morrison-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Thanks, Leigh. Good to be with you.
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Is the combination of coronavirus and the bushfires
going to drive Australia into a recession?
</p>
<img alt="Scott Morrison:" src="scott-morrison-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>I bloody hope not, because that would make me look bad!</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
Well, I'm not getting ahead of these issues.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[…]
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
What we need to do is ensure that the fiscal response
that we will provide […] is very measured and […] scalable […].
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
And when will you be announcing the details of that package
and where will it be targeted?
</p>
<img alt="Scott Morrison:" src="scott-morrison-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
We'll be announcing those soon, Leigh,
and we'll be announcing the key areas we'll be targeting on [sic]
at that time.
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
And is 'soon' before the May federal budget
because one assumes there's a degree of urgency here?
</p>
<img alt="Scott Morrison:" src="scott-morrison-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Yes it is.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>I just enjoy not giving direct answers on the first ask.</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
[…]
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
The Reserve Bank has once again today cut interest rates
to try to bolster the economy […].
The RBA and business leaders have been urging the Government
to come up with a detailed fiscal plan […].
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
How is it possible that you don't have an economic centrepiece
beyond a slogan for jobs and growth?
</p>
<img alt="Scott Morrison:" src="scott-morrison-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Well, I completely reject that, Leigh
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>along with everything else uttered on this program,
unless it's about Labor</i>.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
I mean, last year alone we brought forward
$4.2 billion worth of our program on infrastructure
to address the very issues that you've just raised
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>especially in marginal electorates</i>.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
Last year, we passed tax cuts […]. […]
the Government has been continuing to expand our trade borders […]
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
So I completely just don't accept that allegation, Leigh.
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Well, let me run through some of it with you.
[Income tax cuts'] effect on the economy has been muted
when you look at the major indicators.
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
You have done nothing on IR, nothing on superannuation,
nothing on GST reform, nothing big on company tax reform,
no target for emissions reduction beyond 2030.
Business leaders feel there's no agenda.
</p>
<img alt="Scott Morrison:" src="scott-morrison-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Well, I don't agree with them, Leigh,
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>along with everything else uttered by them,
unless it's about Labor,</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
and at the beginning of the term […]
I set out an agenda that dealt with infrastructure,
that dealt with industrial relations in fact,
quite specifically and…
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Well […] why do you think business leaders
are always out there saying "We need the government to be doing more?"
</p>
<img alt="Scott Morrison:" src="scott-morrison-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Well, let me take the issue they often make on emission reduction.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[…] I'm not going to put on a tax to reduce emissions
nor am I going to put people's jobs
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>or votes</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
at risk or nor am I going to see
rural and regional parts of the economy,
which depend on industries, […] at risk.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
We have an emissions reduction target […]
and we've got a plan to achieve it which is more important.
[…]
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
But you seem to suggest that doing more would be
costing jobs and potentially economic growth.
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
[Britain has] a net-zero-by-2050 policy.
Since 1990 Britain's cut emission by 42 per cent
and at the same time seen a 73 per cent increase in economic growth.
</p>
<img alt="Scott Morrison:" src="scott-morrison-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Well, […] the UK economy
[is] quite different to the Australian economy, Leigh
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>along with the economy of any country in the world
whose climate action credentials are better than Australia,</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
and you've got to have plans that relate to your own country.
[…]
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
[…]
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[…]
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[…] plenty of people that have targets
but if you don't have a plan to achieve them,
then […] you don't know what it's gonna cost,
and you're gonna end up taxing people
and threatening people's jobs
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>and votes</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
without a plan.
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
[…]
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
But when all of the states and territories in Australia
have committed to a zero-emissions target by 2050,
when […] Qantas […] and BHP […],
[…] peak business groups […],
[…] environmentalists and scientists are calling for it,
why is the Federal Government determinedly isolated?
</p>
<img alt="Scott Morrison:" src="scott-morrison-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Leigh, I'm not going to commit to a target,
when I can't look Australians in the eye and tell them
what it costs
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>in votes</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
or how it's going to be achieved.
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Have you done any modelling of the costs
of not going to net zero by 2050?
</p>
<img alt="Scott Morrison:" src="scott-morrison-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
That is why we do take action on climate change, Leigh.
So the argument that it is about
"Oh, what's the cost of not doing anything?"
Well, we are doing something so I don't accept that argument.
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
[…]
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Melbourne University […]
found that the potential economic risk to Australia
if global emissions patterns remain the same
are [$]584 billion by 2020, and [$]762 billion by 2050.
</p>
<img alt="Scott Morrison:" src="scott-morrison-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Well, we're not planning to take no action, Leigh,
so the argument is moot.
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
No, that's if patterns remain the same.
</p>
<img alt="Scott Morrison:" src="scott-morrison-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Well, we're not planning to have patterns remain the same.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
We're planning to reduce emissions
with a technology plan which will achieve that,
but I'm going to do it in a way
where I can look Australians in the eye and say,
I'm not going to put a tax on you,
I'm not going to take your job from you
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>or your votes from us</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
and I'm not going to undermine industries
that are very important to rural and regional Australians.
[…]
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
[…]
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
You won't release the Gaetjens report into the sports rorts.
Your office tried to conceal when you were on holidays
in Hawaii in December.
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
The Government cited national security
to avoid answering a question under FOI
about whether Pastor Brian Houston was invited
to a White House dinner […].
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
Why all the secrecy on stuff,
that on the surface would seem to be not that big a deal?
</p>
<img alt="Scott Morrison:" src="scott-morrison-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Well, those things aren't that big a deal
that you have talked about, Leigh,
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>apart from their being highly embarrassing,</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
and…
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
But why the secrecy then?
</p>
<img alt="Scott Morrison:" src="scott-morrison-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>Oh, sod off.</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
Leigh, I'm just focused on the things
that I took to the Australian people.
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
No no, I just want to know why the secrecy.
You're not answering what I am asking.
</p>
<img alt="Scott Morrison:" src="scott-morrison-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>I know I'm not. Screw you.</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
Leigh, well, I have disclosed the issues that you have referred to.
[…]
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
[…]
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
I'm putting to you three examples where there has been secrecy,
but I can't understand why you would have secrecy around [them].
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
Say, for example, Brian Houston.
You've said this afternoon you invited him to the White House.
</p>
<img alt="Scott Morrison:" src="scott-morrison-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Let me deal with the issue of the governance committee, Leigh.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[…]
That is a governance committee of Cabinet
which deals with very sensitive information
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>i.e. things which embarrass the government</i>.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Well, what about the Brian Houston thing.
Why did you keep that a secret?
</p>
<img alt="Scott Morrison:" src="scott-morrison-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Well, Leigh, at the time I was in the United States.
We'd had a very important meeting
with the President of the United States.
It was not a matter I was intending to be distracted
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>or embarrassed</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
by.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
And look, at the time, I could have answered the question differently.
I have been up front about that
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>and by being up front now about not being up front before,
I think everything cancels out,</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
but honestly […] it was not a significant matter,
and people haven't asked me about it for months […].
[…]
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
But the only reason I'm asking about it,
because it is a minor matter,
<em>is</em> because of the secrecy around it.
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
I mean,
there was an FOI request put in about it that came back and said that
the information couldn't be disclosed
because it would jeopardise Australia's relationship
with the United States.
</p>
<img alt="Scott Morrison:" src="scott-morrison-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Well, the allegations that were being made
at the time when I was in the United States
went around possible leaks out of the President's office.
[…]
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
As a guest in that country at the time
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>i.e. an arse-kisser</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
I didn't think that to be a very discreet way or diplomatic way
to handle those questions.
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Prime Minister, appreciate your time.
Thank you for joining us this evening.
</p>
<img alt="Scott Morrison:" src="scott-morrison-2020-03-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Thanks a lot, Leigh.
