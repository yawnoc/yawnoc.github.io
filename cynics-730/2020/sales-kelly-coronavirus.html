<p class="interview-host">
You've said that most new cases
are still coming into Australia from overseas.
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
There were some pretty <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-26/coronavirus-fears-at-sydney-airport-after-video-shows-long-lines/12092796">confronting scenes</a> today at Sydney Airport,
where big crowds of people were arriving and going to be temperature tested
in spaces where there was <em>clearly</em> insufficient room for
any sort of social distancing.
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
How can a situation like that be allowed to happen?
</p>
<img alt="Paul Kelly:" src="paul-kelly-2020-03-26.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>Incompetence?</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
A couple of things I'd say about that:
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
One is, that the numbers of people returning from overseas
are decreasing quite rapidly.
But there's still several thousand people every day.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>Now, as intelligent a person as I am (a Professor at ANU),
I shall pretend that your point is about the testing,
and not the amount of space.</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
Uh… it's interesting that you would say that
people were concerned about being held up for temperature testing.
Of course, a few days ago we were being criticised
for not testing enough at the airport.
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-26.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host thought">
<i>Christ, you sound like a politician.
You're supposed to be a medical expert.</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
I'm not saying that they were concerned about that.
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
I'm saying that the concern was
the amount of space that had been allocated.
</p>
<p class="interview-host thought">
<i>Don't you have any shame?</i>
</p>
<img alt="Paul Kelly:" src="paul-kelly-2020-03-26.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>Apparently not. Let me ignore your question and change the topic.</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
Yeah, and that's one of the reasons why
we've gone to the 14 days of self-isolation.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>Verily, before 15 March,
we travelled forward in time
and saw today's packed queues at Sydney Airport,
and this influenced our decision
to extend the 14-day isolation requirement
to <em>all</em> international arrivals from 15 March.</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
That means staying at home, umm, because…
airports are not set up for this sort of thing
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>so it's the airport's fault, for being an incompetent airport</i>.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-26.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Can you explain to people watching tonight
why the health body that advises the government
is not opting for the extreme lockdown measures
that are being used in the UK and in New Zealand?
[…]
</p>
<img alt="Paul Kelly:" src="paul-kelly-2020-03-26.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
In terms of […] should we go hard-and-fast
or should we have a proportionate response
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>note how I use "proportion<em>ate</em>"
rather than "proportion<em>al</em>",
so as to imply, from the outset of my answer,
that hard-and-fast is disproportion<em>ate</em></i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
that can be scaled over time, uh…
there is a difference of opinion, I'll agree with that.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[…] [COVID-19] is an infectious disease,
it's transmitted from person to person,
it's mostly when you're very close to another person,
and you increase that by being in large crowds of people
who may or may not have the infection
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>such as high-density queues for Centrelink
or for temperature screening at Sydney Airport</i>.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-26.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Why was the half-hour advice given about hairdressers
and then changed so soon after,
how does that square with the assurance that
all the restrictions follow expert medical advice?
</p>
<img alt="Paul Kelly:" src="paul-kelly-2020-03-26.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>Iunno.</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
In terms of hairdressers […]
it's impractical to keep the […] 1.5 metres […]
but there are many other things that people can do […].
So minimising the time is one of them. […]
Second of all if you are sick, don't go and get your hair cut.
If you are a sick hairdresser, don't go to work.
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-26.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
But you're not answering the actual question, which is regarding
how the rule can be changed from one day to the next
if the restrictions are based on the medical advice.
</p>
<img alt="Paul Kelly:" src="paul-kelly-2020-03-26.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>Incompetence?</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
Uh look, the advice we give goes to the Cabinet;
the Cabinet have their discussions;
I'm not privy to how those discussions went […].
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
Things are changing every day here […]
and that was one of the things that was changed today.
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-26.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Dr Kelly, thanks for your time.
</p>
<img alt="Paul Kelly:" src="paul-kelly-2020-03-26.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
You're welcome, Leigh.
