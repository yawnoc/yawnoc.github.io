<h2>Energy Minister Angus Taylor discusses carbon emissions and Clover Moore</h2>
<div class="interview">
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
Minister, thanks for your time.
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Thanks for having me, Leigh.

On energy policy,
is the Federal Government going to pay
to keep the Liddell power station open,
the one that AGL wants to close in 2023?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{Blame media for asking questions and go to talking points:}
</p>
<p class="guest">
Well, I think everyone's getting a bit ahead of themselves here
with some speculative reporting, Leigh.
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…] the way to get prices down to ensure […]
affordable reliable energy
and [that] industry in Australia continues to prosper and be successful…
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
I notice you're not answering the question.
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="guest">
… in the future is to get […]
more supply into the market and avoid supply leaving.
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
Are you going to pay to keep the Liddell power station open?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="guest">
So I'm not going to speculate on the outcomes of the Liddell Taskforce
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{because I already have a good idea of what they will be,
given what the Taskforce is supposed to be examining}.
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
What do you think is the timeframe
for Australia to transition away from coal?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{The same time as it would take
for every human alive today to be turned into fossil fuel.}
</p>
<p class="guest">
Well, I mean, it's not about coal, it's about emissions.
[…] we need to play our part in helping to reduce global emissions.
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
But I'm actually not asking about emissions,
I just want to ask about coal because
AGL says coal should be done in about 50&nbsp;years.
[…] South&nbsp;32, BHP, Rio Tinto, they're getting away from coal now.
</p>
<p class="host">
[…] as a relevant minister, what do you think is the timeframe
in which Australia is going to be getting away from coal?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well, I understand you're asking that question but
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{I want to talk about emissions today and not coal,
even though normally I would want to talk about coal and not emissions,
and}
</p>
<p class="guest">
the point I'm making to you is it's about emissions
and emissions come from much more than coal
and they come from much more than the electricity sector…
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{including farting livestock,
as comrade Barnaby already discussed
in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9FFWxbVCc" title="Barnaby Joyce and Joel Fitzgibbon clash at joint media conference in Parliament House | 7NEWS">pleasant chat</a> with Joel Fitzgibbon last week}.
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
But I'm asking about coal. I'm just narrowly asking about coal.
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="guest">
… I know you are
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{i.e.&nbsp;I am effectively giving you the finger}
</p>
<p class="guest">
and my point is there's [<i>sic</i>] many ways to reduce emissions.
[…] 2020 targets we'll beat easily,
2030 targets, <em>and</em> driving emissions beyond that.
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{Driving emissions <em>downwards</em>, not upwards I think.}
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
On your point that the 2030 targets we'll meet easily,
what's your source for that?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well, the government department. I mean, we are on track already…
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
But exactly which government department is saying that
because I've got figures from various government departments?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="guest">
My government department. […]
We've got a plan laid out to the last tonne
as to how we are going to reach our emissions targets
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{a completely inapt rhetorical device,
given that mass is a continuous quantity}.
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…]
</p>
<p class="host">

<p class="guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
Do you still maintain
that the falsified document that your office distributed
about the Sydney City Council's travel bill
came from its own website?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Yes, I mean my statement on this was clear from the start
and I'd add to that, Leigh…
</p>
<p class="host">
[…]
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…] This has been considered and closed by two independent police forces.
We had the AFP Commissioner today saying
the matter is finalised, full stop.
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{Although my office really really really did nothing wrong,
thank Christ the investigation is over.
Who cares about the <em>real</em> culprit over at Sydney City Council?}
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
How do you explain the inconsistency
between your story and the metadata produced by the Sydney City Council
showing that the document as distributed never appeared on their website?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well, that's a matter for them. […]
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{It's definitely their fault,
but for some reason I don't want an investigation.}
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
But aren't you bothered […]?
You have had a lot of trouble because of this and I'm just wondering,
aren't you curious yourself as to what that inconsistency is?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Leigh, we've had two independent police forces look at this.
[…]
They have both considered and closed this matter and as I said,
the AFP Commissioner today said that the matter is finalised, full stop
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{which makes two full stops}.
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
But the New South Wales Police referred the matter to the AFP;
the AFP dropped its investigation.
</p>
<p class="host">
Today the commissioner told a senate estimates committee that
the police did <em>not</em> interview the Sydney Lord Mayor;
they also didn't interview you.
</p>
<p class="host">
Given that what happened damaged your reputation, […]
you must be disappointed at the lack of a thorough investigation?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Haha, Leigh, two police forces have looked at this.
It's been pretty thorough
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{or about as thorough as the look I gave
those highly reasonable spending figures in that document
which my office had absolutely nothing to do with}…
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
They didn't interview you, they didn't interview the Lord Mayor?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well, that was a choice they made
but it's very clear what the position is here.
</p>
<p class="guest">
The commissioner […] was very clear:
it's been finalised and the matter is closed, full stop
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{which makes three full stops}.
</p>
<p class="host">
[…]
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
I keep coming back to this. […]
You are […] the face of it, […] at the front-line of it.
Why aren't you worried about it?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Because I've made a very clear statement on it
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{namely "My office and I totally did nothing wrong",}
</p>
<p class="guest">
[… t]wo police forces have looked at it [and] the matter's closed
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{which is the perfect outcome for me, the innocent one in all of this.
I am eternally grateful to the police commissioner
for delivering true justice}.
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
Minister, thank you very much for joining us this evening.

Thanks for having me, Leigh.
