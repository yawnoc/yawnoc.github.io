<h2>Josh Frydenberg says the Government's surplus prediction was based on 'forecasts at the time'</h2>
<div class="interview">
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
The Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, is with me now from Canberra.
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
Treasurer, let me start with a question in your capacity,
as a member of the National Security Committee of Cabinet:
why is the current decision not to close Australia's borders
or to cancel mass events?
</p>
<img alt="Josh Frydenberg:" src="josh-frydenberg-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>Because the advice we've received says so.</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[…]
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
The best possible medical advice to us is that
[the existing] travel restrictions should stay in place
but they shouldn't be extended to other countries,
including to broader Europe.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
So we'll continue to take the best possible advice
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>and blame the advisors if necessary</i>.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
When it comes to mass gatherings, again,
we take the advice of the chief medical officer […].
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
Of course, states can take their own decisions
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>which I welcome, since <em>they</em> would then take the blame
for any public-health or economy-related consequences
associated with those decisions,
instead of us,</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
but right now the advice is not to avoid those mass gatherings.
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
[…]
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Given how quickly this situation is evolving,
is it possible that the stimulus package you've announced today
could be the first of a number of them for the Australian economy?
</p>
<img alt="Josh Frydenberg:" src="josh-frydenberg-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>I hope not,
I would really like to see a surplus before the next election…</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
Well this is a very substantial package […]
in response to a pretty significant economic impact.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[…]
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
But of course, the budget is in eight weeks' time
and the coronavirus is not going away,
so we'll continue to do what is necessary
to support the Australian economy.
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
You mentioned the budget,
you've made these measures temporary so they're not baked into the budget,
but isn't this a time to <em>use</em> the budget
to also make some structural changes,
for example bringing forward your planned income tax cuts
across all brackets?
</p>
<img alt="Josh Frydenberg:" src="josh-frydenberg-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>I'll take that as a compliment.</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
Well again, we've shown our mettle when it comes to reducing taxes.
We've passed through the Parliament over $300 billion of tax cuts…
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
I didn't ask what you've done, I asked about what you might do.
</p>
<img alt="Josh Frydenberg:" src="josh-frydenberg-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>I know, but free airtime for the Coalition &amp; tax cuts…</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
Yeah, but in terms of what we have announced today,
there is [sic] substantial incentives through the tax system
for businesses to invest,
and that continues to be a priority for us.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[…] the actual initiatives [for our stimulus package] are
targeted, […] temporary and […] proportionate […].
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
But that doesn't address my question which is,
shouldn't the budget be used to make some structural changes
that can help the country's fiscal position going forward?
</p>
<img alt="Josh Frydenberg:" src="josh-frydenberg-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>The Coalition's tax cuts are good!</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
Well we continue to undertake structural reform
and that includes our tax legislation that passed through the Parliament.
But today's announcements had pretty substantial…
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
You're still not addressing, sorry Treasurer, what I'm asking.
</p>
<img alt="Josh Frydenberg:" src="josh-frydenberg-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>Oh I don't know. Wait till the budget.</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
Well, in terms of what comes forward in the budget,
you'll have to switch on in May for that outcome.
[…]
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>The Coalition doesn't spend as much as Labor!</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
But Leigh, we have done the hard yards,
over the last six and a half years
to bring the budget back into balance,
which has given us now the flexibility
to use this financial firepower at a time when it's needed most.
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
You'll only be able to tell in hindsight if you've made the right decision
about the size of today's stimulus package
and the way the money is directed.
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
Will its success be judged on whether or not Australia avoids recession?
</p>
<img alt="Josh Frydenberg:" src="josh-frydenberg-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
[…] what we'll see is $11 billion go into the economy
before June the 30th […].
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
But how do you judge the success of it, Treasurer?
</p>
<img alt="Josh Frydenberg:" src="josh-frydenberg-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Well, how I judge the success of it
is that it supports the Australian economy,
keeps people in a job
and it keeps businesses in business […].
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>In other words, if we do avoid recession,
then I'll be judging it on the fact that we avoided recession,
but if we don't avoid recession,
then I won't be judging it on the fact that we didn't avoid recession.</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Last year you were claiming credit
for a surplus that you'd not yet delivered,
saying the budget was back in black.
You were warned at the time
that global events could derail that prospect,
which they now have.
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
What does your premature rush to claim credit for a phantom surplus
say about your political maturity and judgement?
</p>
<p class="interview-host thought">
<i>There. Nailed him.</i>
</p>
<img alt="Josh Frydenberg:" src="josh-frydenberg-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>Ouch… Er, my premature rush did help us get re-elected,
so I think it says good things
about my political maturity and judgement?</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
Well, we took the best possible advice
[…] based on the forecasts at the time […]
we've now taken these major spending decisions
and the surplus won't arrive in '19/20
as a result of some of these circumstances we've seen.
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
But Treasurer, you claimed credit
for something that you hadn't yet delivered
and I'm just wondering why you did that
when at the time you were warned that events could derail it
and they have?
</p>
<img alt="Josh Frydenberg:" src="josh-frydenberg-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Well, […] we made our presentation
based on the forecasts at the time,
and clearly when it comes to
the fires, […] flood, […] drought and […] coronavirus,
the economy has been hit by a number of external economic shocks
that have been beyond our control.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>My premature rush to take credit was also beyond my control.</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
When it comes to our response…
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
But, Treasurer, can I…
</p>
<img alt="Josh Frydenberg:" src="josh-frydenberg-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
… we can control that.
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Sorry to interrupt you there.
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
You say, you know, these external shocks,
you couldn't have seen them coming.
Treasury budget papers did warn about this kind of thing.
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
I want to play our audience something
from around the time of the budget last year.
</p>
<img alt="Josh Frydenberg:" src="josh-frydenberg-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>You're going to make me look like a proper dickhead now, right?</i>
</p>
<img alt="Leigh Sales:" src="leigh-sales-2020-03-12.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host thought">
<i>Yep.</i>

Like any projection,
your ability to deliver that $7 billion surplus
is reliant on factors that are outside your control;
it might not happen?
</p>
<img alt="Josh Frydenberg:" src="josh-frydenberg-2019-04-02-730.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
No, it <em>will</em> happen
and it's the product of bringing the spending under control.
