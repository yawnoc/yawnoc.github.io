  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Prime Minister, welcome to the program. Thank you for your time.
  --

  ![Scott Morrison:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Thanks, Leigh. Good to be with you.
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Is the combination of coronavirus and the bushfires
  going to drive Australia into a recession?
  --

  ![Scott Morrison:]
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _I bloody hope not, because that would make me look bad!_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well, I'm not getting ahead of these issues.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  What we need to do is ensure that the fiscal response
  that we will provide [...] is very measured and [...] scalable [...].
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  And when will you be announcing the details of that package
  and where will it be targeted?
  --

  ![Scott Morrison:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  We'll be announcing those soon, Leigh,
  and we'll be announcing the key areas we'll be targeting on [sic]
  at that time.
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  And is 'soon' before the May federal budget
  because one assumes there's a degree of urgency here?
  --

  ![Scott Morrison:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Yes it is.
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _I just enjoy not giving direct answers on the first ask._
  --

  --{.interview-host}
  [...]
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  The Reserve Bank has once again today cut interest rates
  to try to bolster the economy [...].
  The RBA and business leaders have been urging the Government
  to come up with a detailed fiscal plan [...].
  --
  --{.interview-host}
  How is it possible that you don't have an economic centrepiece
  beyond a slogan for jobs and growth?
  --

  ![Scott Morrison:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well, I completely reject that, Leigh
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _along with everything else uttered on this program,
  unless it's about Labor_.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  I mean, last year alone we brought forward
  $4.2~billion worth of our program on infrastructure
  to address the very issues that you've just raised
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _especially in marginal electorates_.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  Last year, we passed tax cuts [...]. [...]
  the Government has been continuing to expand our trade borders [...]
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  So I completely just don't accept that allegation, Leigh.
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Well, let me run through some of it with you.
  [Income tax cuts'] effect on the economy has been muted
  when you look at the major indicators.
  --
  --{.interview-host}
  You have done nothing on IR, nothing on superannuation,
  nothing on GST reform, nothing big on company tax reform,
  no target for emissions reduction beyond 2030.
  Business leaders feel there's no agenda.
  --

  ![Scott Morrison:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well, I don't agree with them, Leigh,
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _along with everything else uttered by them,
  unless it's about Labor,_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  and at the beginning of the term [...]
  I set out an agenda that dealt with infrastructure,
  that dealt with industrial relations in fact,
  quite specifically and...
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Well [...] why do you think business leaders
  are always out there saying "We need the government to be doing more?"
  --

  ![Scott Morrison:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well, let me take the issue they often make on emission reduction.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...] I'm not going to put on a tax to reduce emissions
  nor am I going to put people's jobs
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _or votes_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  at risk or nor am I going to see
  rural and regional parts of the economy,
  which depend on industries, [...] at risk.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  We have an emissions reduction target [...]
  and we've got a plan to achieve it which is more important.
  [...]
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  But you seem to suggest that doing more would be
  costing jobs and potentially economic growth.
  --
  --{.interview-host}
  [Britain has] a net-zero-by-2050 policy.
  Since 1990 Britain's cut emission by 42 per cent
  and at the same time seen a 73 per cent increase in economic growth.
  --

  ![Scott Morrison:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well, [...] the UK economy
  [is] quite different to the Australian economy, Leigh
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _along with the economy of any country in the world
  whose climate action credentials are better than Australia,_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  and you've got to have plans that relate to your own country.
  [...]
  --

  --{.interview-host}
  [...]
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...] plenty of people that have targets
  but if you don't have a plan to achieve them,
  then [...] you don't know what it's gonna cost,
  and you're gonna end up taxing people
  and threatening people's jobs
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _and votes_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  without a plan.
  --

  --{.interview-host}
  [...]
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  But when all of the states and territories in Australia
  have committed to a zero-emissions target by 2050,
  when [...] Qantas [...] and BHP [...],
  [...] peak business groups [...],
  [...] environmentalists and scientists are calling for it,
  why is the Federal Government determinedly isolated?
  --

  ![Scott Morrison:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Leigh, I'm not going to commit to a target,
  when I can't look Australians in the eye and tell them
  what it costs
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _in votes_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  or how it's going to be achieved.
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Have you done any modelling of the costs
  of not going to net zero by 2050?
  --

  ![Scott Morrison:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  That is why we do take action on climate change, Leigh.
  So the argument that it is about
    "Oh, what's the cost of not doing anything?"
  Well, we are doing something so I don't accept that argument.
  --

  --{.interview-host}
  [...]
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Melbourne University [...]
  found that the potential economic risk to Australia
  if global emissions patterns remain the same
  are [$]584~billion by 2020, and [$]762~billion by 2050.
  --

  ![Scott Morrison:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well, we're not planning to take no action, Leigh,
  so the argument is moot.
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  No, that's if patterns remain the same.
  --

  ![Scott Morrison:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well, we're not planning to have patterns remain the same.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  We're planning to reduce emissions
  with a technology plan which will achieve that,
  but I'm going to do it in a way
  where I can look Australians in the eye and say,
  I'm not going to put a tax on you,
  I'm not going to take your job from you
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _or your votes from us_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  and I'm not going to undermine industries
  that are very important to rural and regional Australians.
  [...]
  --

  --{.interview-host}
  [...]
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  You won't release the Gaetjens report into the sports rorts.
  Your office tried to conceal when you were on holidays
  in Hawaii in December.
  --
  --{.interview-host}
  The Government cited national security
  to avoid answering a question under FOI
  about whether Pastor Brian Houston was invited
  to a White House dinner [...].
  --
  --{.interview-host}
  Why all the secrecy on stuff,
  that on the surface would seem to be not that big a deal?
  --

  ![Scott Morrison:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well, those things aren't that big a deal
  that you have talked about, Leigh,
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _apart from their being highly embarrassing,_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  and...
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  But why the secrecy then?
  --

  ![Scott Morrison:]
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _Oh, sod off._
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  Leigh, I'm just focused on the things
  that I took to the Australian people.
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  No no, I just want to know why the secrecy.
  You're not answering what I am asking.
  --

  ![Scott Morrison:]
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _I know I'm not. Screw you._
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  Leigh, well, I have disclosed the issues that you have referred to.
  [...]
  --

  --{.interview-host}
  [...]
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  I'm putting to you three examples where there has been secrecy,
  but I can't understand why you would have secrecy around [them].
  --
  --{.interview-host}
  Say, for example, Brian Houston.
  You've said this afternoon you invited him to the White House.
  --

  ![Scott Morrison:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Let me deal with the issue of the governance committee, Leigh.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  That is a governance committee of Cabinet
  which deals with very sensitive information
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _i.e.~things which embarrass the government_.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Well, what about the Brian Houston thing.
  Why did you keep that a secret?
  --

  ![Scott Morrison:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well, Leigh, at the time I was in the United States.
  We'd had a very important meeting
  with the President of the United States.
  It was not a matter I was intending to be distracted
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _or embarrassed_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  by.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  And look, at the time, I could have answered the question differently.
  I have been up front about that
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _and by being up front now about not being up front before,
  I think everything cancels out,_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  but honestly [...] it was not a significant matter,
  and people haven't asked me about it for months [...].
  [...]
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  But the only reason I'm asking about it,
  because it is a minor matter,
  *is* because of the secrecy around it.
  --
  --{.interview-host}
  I mean,
  there was an FOI request put in about it that came back and said that
  the information couldn't be disclosed
  because it would jeopardise Australia's relationship
  with the United States.
  --

  ![Scott Morrison:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well, the allegations that were being made
  at the time when I was in the United States
  went around possible leaks out of the President's office.
  [...]
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  As a guest in that country at the time
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _i.e.~an arse-kisser_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  I didn't think that to be a very discreet way or diplomatic way
  to handle those questions.
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
   Prime Minister, appreciate your time.
   Thank you for joining us this evening.
  --

  ![Scott Morrison:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Thanks a lot, Leigh.
