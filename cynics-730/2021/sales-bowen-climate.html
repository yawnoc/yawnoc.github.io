<p class="host">
Chris Bowen, thanks for coming on.
</p>
<img alt="CHRIS BOWEN" class="guest" src="chris-bowen-2021-02-02.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Pleasure Leigh, good evening.
</p>
<p class="host">
[…]
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2021-02-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
So, let's say people in coal mines in the Hunter Valley do lose their jobs;
what kind of new jobs would you see them transitioning into?
</p>
<img alt="CHRIS BOWEN" class="guest" src="chris-bowen-2021-02-02.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well, um, I see many thousands of jobs
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{of unspecified type}
</p>
<p class="guest">
being created by good climate change policy,
both […] [in] renewable energy,
and also in reinvigorating traditional manufacturing industries […].
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2021-02-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
So manufacturing jobs:
like what sort of manufacturing would you see happening
somewhere like the Hunter?
</p>
<img alt="CHRIS BOWEN" class="guest" src="chris-bowen-2021-02-02.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Oh, well, um, when you get the policy settings right,
then the private sector can invest in all sorts of opportunities
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{again of unspecified type, but this time I'll throw in some electorates:}
</p>
<p class="guest">
in the Hunter, in Western Sydney, in Western Melbourne,
right across the country.
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2021-02-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
So I guess, […] if I was sitting in the Hunter watching this tonight,
what I want to know is, […] in concrete terms,
like what sort of a job would I have?
[…] do you mean […] in a factory? on an assembly line?
Like what sort of jobs do you mean?
</p>
<img alt="CHRIS BOWEN" class="guest" src="chris-bowen-2021-02-02.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well, I mean jobs that'll be created across the board, Leigh,
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{and the scope is so wide that I can't name a specific example.}
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2021-02-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
Before the last election,
Labor pledged a 45 per cent cut to emissions by 2030.
[…]
What <em>has</em> changed, now that that target is seen as too ambitious?
</p>
<img alt="CHRIS BOWEN" class="guest" src="chris-bowen-2021-02-02.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well, we haven't been in office, Leigh, […]
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2021-02-02.jpg">
<p class="host thought-bubble">
{That's not a change,
but I'll hand it to you for making a frank admission…}
</p>
<img alt="CHRIS BOWEN" class="guest" src="chris-bowen-2021-02-02.jpg">
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{No no no! Totally am not admitting we need to
make our climate policy less ambitious to get elected!}
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…] Now we've got a very clear commitment to net zero by 2050…
</p>
<p class="host">
[…]

<p class="guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2021-02-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
Labor has had trouble getting its own party united on a policy in this area.
If you can't persuade your own party on one direction,
how will you be able to persuade the electorate?
</p>
<img alt="CHRIS BOWEN" class="guest" src="chris-bowen-2021-02-02.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well, I don't necessarily agree with that Leigh,
because everybody in the Labor Party
accepts that climate change is real and we need a policy to deal with it
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{except Joel Fitzgibbon, who thinks we need a policy to not lose elections}.
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2021-02-02.jpg">
<p class="host">
Yeah, but there's a lot of wiggle room after that…
</p>
<img alt="CHRIS BOWEN" class="guest" src="chris-bowen-2021-02-02.jpg">
<p class="guest">
[…]
In the Labor Party, sure we have a policy debate about mechanisms etc.
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{particularly for selecting the party leader,}
</p>
<p class="guest">
but we are all 100 per cent committed to a climate change policy,
which deals with man—
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{whoopsie-daisy}
</p>
<p class="guest">
—uh humankind causing climate change.

Chris Bowen, thank you very much.
