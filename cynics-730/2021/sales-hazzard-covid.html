<h2>NSW COVID outbreak started by an unvaccinated driver</h2>
<div class="interview">
<img alt="LEIGH SALES:" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2021-06-17.jpg">
<p class="host">
Minister, why was an unvaccinated driver allowed
anywhere near an international flight crew?
</p>
<img alt="BRAD HAZZARD:" class="guest" src="brad-hazzard-2021-06-17.jpg">
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{But first, let me preface with a non-answer about saliva:}
</p>
<p class="guest">
The current arrangements […] are that there should be,
every day, a saliva test undertaken [etc. etc.].
</p>
<p class="guest">
It would appear that uh, he <em>may</em> have <em>had</em> the saliva test
[blah blah etc. etc.].
</p>
<p class="guest">
[Having vaccines] hasn't been mandatory to date, but at any rate,
we've announced today that we'll be reviewing that situation
because of the current circumstances.
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES:" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2021-06-17.jpg">
<p class="host">
How come every time […] the minister responsible,
regardless of the state, says,
"Oh yep, okay, we'll have to review it to make sure it doesn't happen again."
Cause [vaccinated drivers and daily testing] seem really obvious […].
It's not rocket science.
</p>
<img alt="BRAD HAZZARD:" class="guest" src="brad-hazzard-2021-06-17.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Yeah uhh… thank you for that, Leigh,
but the reality is that we are in a 1-in-100-year pandemic…
and it's the "unknown unknowns".
[…]
</p>
<p class="guest">
There has been a reluctance through National Cabinet
to have mandatory testing
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{so blame them}.
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES:" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2021-06-17.jpg">
<p class="host">
Do you reckon that the audience would buy that an unvaccinated driver
picking up an infection from an international flight crew
is an "unknown unknown"?
</p>
<img alt="BRAD HAZZARD:" class="guest" src="brad-hazzard-2021-06-17.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well, I just said it was…
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES:" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2021-06-17.jpg">
<p class="host thought-bubble">
{Yeah nah.}
</p>
<p class="host">
But how can that be?
</p>
<img alt="BRAD HAZZARD:" class="guest" src="brad-hazzard-2021-06-17.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well… it <em>was</em>.
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{And it helps run down the clock in this interview.}
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…] There are other factors.
[…] the companies that actually engage these drivers,
often as employees or subcontractors
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{who are cheaper},
</p>
<p class="guest">
have expressed concerns […]
that they may not be able to get drivers to actually do the job
if we actually force them to have the vaccine
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{unless we pay them more, which we won't}.
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES:" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2021-06-17.jpg">
<p class="host">
New South Wales has a higher appetite for risk than other states […].
</p>
<p class="host">
What assurance can you give […] that it isn't just luck
that this is the first incident of its kind?
</p>
<img alt="BRAD HAZZARD:" class="guest" src="brad-hazzard-2021-06-17.jpg">
<p class="guest">
[…] We take the majority of people coming back from overseas
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{but don't you dare talk to me about NSW's larger population}.
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…] we've taken over 190,000 people.
That's about 10&nbsp;times what WA's taken
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{which is just begging for a fact-check, because
