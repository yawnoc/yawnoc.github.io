  \leigh-sales
  ----{.h}
  Minister, why was an unvaccinated driver allowed
  anywhere near an international flight crew?
  ----
  
  \brad-hazzard
  ----{.gt}
  {But first, let me preface with a non-answer about saliva:}
  ----
  ----{.g}
  The current arrangements [...] are that there should be,
  every day, a saliva test undertaken [etc. etc.].
  ----
  ----{.g}
  It would appear that uh, he *may* have *had* the saliva test
  [blah blah etc. etc.].
  ----
  ----{.g}
  [Having vaccines] hasn't been mandatory to date, but at any rate,
  we've announced today that we'll be reviewing that situation
  because of the current circumstances.
  ----
  
  \leigh-sales
  ----{.h}
  How come every time [...] the minister responsible,
  regardless of the state, says,
  "Oh yep, okay, we'll have to review it to make sure it doesn't happen again."
  Cause [vaccinated drivers and daily testing] seem really obvious [...].
  It's not rocket science.
  ----
  
  \brad-hazzard
  ----{.g}
  Yeah uhh... thank you for that, Leigh,
  but the reality is that we are in a 1-in-100-year pandemic...
  and it's the "unknown unknowns".
  [...]
  ----
  ----{.g}
  There has been a reluctance through National Cabinet
  to have mandatory testing
  ----
  ----{.gt}
  {so blame them}.
  ----
  ----{.g}
  [...]
  ----
  
  \leigh-sales
  ----{.h}
  Do you reckon that the audience would buy that an unvaccinated driver
  picking up an infection from an international flight crew
  is an "unknown unknown"?
  ----
  
  \brad-hazzard
  ----{.g}
  Well, I just said it was...
  ----
  
  \leigh-sales
  ----{.ht}
  {Yeah nah.}
  ----
  ----{.h}
  But how can that be?
  ----
  
  \brad-hazzard
  ----{.g}
  Well... it *was*.
  ----
  ----{.gt}
  {And it helps run down the clock in this interview.}
  ----
  ----{.g}
  [...] There are other factors.
  [...] the companies that actually engage these drivers,
  often as employees or subcontractors
  ----
  ----{.gt}
  {who are cheaper},
  ----
  ----{.g}
  have expressed concerns [...]
  that they may not be able to get drivers to actually do the job
  if we actually force them to have the vaccine
  ----
  ----{.gt}
  {unless we pay them more, which we won't}.
  ----
  
  \leigh-sales
  ----{.h}
  New South Wales has a higher appetite for risk than other states [...].
  ----
  ----{.h}
  What assurance can you give [...] that it isn't just luck
  that this is the first incident of its kind?
  ----
  
  \brad-hazzard
  ----{.g}
  [...] We take the majority of people coming back from overseas
  ----
  ----{.gt}
  {but don't you dare talk to me about NSW's larger population}.
  ----
  ----{.g}
  [...] we've taken over 190,000 people.
  That's about 10~times what WA's taken
  ----
  ----{.gt}
  {which is just begging for a fact-check, because
  [Dr~Tarun Weeramanthri's Interim Advice #1 from 4~Feb 2021][wa #1]
  ([archived version][wa #1 archived])
  says that """Over 37,000 people have been through the HQ system in WA"""}.
