  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Chris Bowen, thanks for coming on.
  --

  ![Chris Bowen:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Pleasure Leigh, good evening.
  --

  --{.interview-host}
  [...]
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  So, let's say people in coal mines in the Hunter Valley do lose their jobs;
  what kind of new jobs would you see them transitioning into?
  --

  ![Chris Bowen:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well, um, I see many thousands of jobs
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _of unspecified type_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  being created by good climate change policy,
  both [...] [in] renewable energy,
  and also in reinvigorating traditional manufacturing industries [...].
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  So manufacturing jobs:
  like what sort of manufacturing would you see happening
  somewhere like the Hunter?
  --

  ![Chris Bowen:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Oh, well, um, when you get the policy settings right,
  then the private sector can invest in all sorts of opportunities
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _again of unspecified type, but this time I'll throw in some electorates:_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  in the Hunter, in Western Sydney, in Western Melbourne,
  right across the country.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  So I guess, [...] if I was sitting in the Hunter watching this tonight,
  what I want to know is, [...] in concrete terms,
  like what sort of a job would I have?
  [...] do you mean [...] in a factory? on an assembly line?
  Like what sort of jobs do you mean?
  --

  ![Chris Bowen:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well, I mean jobs that'll be created across the board, Leigh,
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _and the scope is so wide that I can't name a specific example._
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Before the last election,
  Labor pledged a 45 per cent cut to emissions by 2030.
  [...]
  What *has* changed, now that that target is seen as too ambitious?
  --

  ![Chris Bowen:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well, we haven't been in office, Leigh, [...]
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host .thought}
  _That's not a change,
  but I'll hand it to you for making a frank admission..._
  --

  ![Chris Bowen:]
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _No no no! Totally am not admitting we need to
  make our climate policy less ambitious to get elected!_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...] Now we've got a very clear commitment to net zero by 2050...
  --

  --{.interview-host}
  [...]
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Labor has had trouble getting its own party united on a policy in this area.
  If you can't persuade your own party on one direction,
  how will you be able to persuade the electorate?
  --

  ![Chris Bowen:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well, I don't necessarily agree with that Leigh,
  because everybody in the Labor Party
  accepts that climate change is real and we need a policy to deal with it
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _except Joel Fitzgibbon, who thinks we need a policy to not lose elections_.
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Yeah, but there's a lot of wiggle room after that...
  --

  ![Chris Bowen:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  In the Labor Party, sure we have a policy debate about mechanisms etc.
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _particularly for selecting the party leader,_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  but we are all 100 per cent committed to a climate change policy,
  which deals with man---
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _whoopsie-daisy_
  --
  ----{.interview-guest}
  ---uh humankind causing climate change.
  ----

  --{.interview-host}
  [...]
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --

  ![Leigh Sales:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Chris Bowen, thank you very much.
  --

  ![Chris Bowen:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Thank you, Leigh.
