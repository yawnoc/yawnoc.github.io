<h2>David Speers interviews Samantha McCulloch</h2>
<div class="interview">
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Samantha McCulloch is the chief executive of the
Australian Petroleum Production &amp; Exploration Association,
which represents gas producers.
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
Samantha McCulloch, welcome to the program.
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Thanks for having me David.
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
So the industry minister says the problem with gas prices right now
is "a glut of greed" by the gas companies. Is he right?
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>Oh, what a direct question! But first, talking points:</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
David what we're seeing is high energy prices across the globe.
This is the result of a global energy crisis,
triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
It's affecting all energy sources, and it's affecting all countries.
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
But can you explain to me,
why that should push up the price of <em>Australian</em> gas, in Australia?
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
We're seeing
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>specifically ogling, and salivating at</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
very strong demand for gas domestically. […]
It's increasing demand for gas that's driving up these prices,
as well as of course international pressures.
And the key to driving down these prices […] is increasing supply.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
That's what the industry is seeking to do,
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>within the constraints of maximising profit,</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
but we need a clear runway, for more investment,
to boost supply, and put downward pressure on prices.
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Well, OK but you did say a few days ago yourself,
"The domestic market is well supplied."
And the agreement that was struck only just over a month ago
[…] was about boosting supply […].
Supply doesn't appear to be the problem does it?
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
The gas industry is committed, to supplying
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>at exorbitant prices</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
the domestic market, and the domestic market has been well supplied.
The heads of agreement that were struck […]
committed to ensuring adequate supply for the domestic market.
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
So what's the problem with supply? Is <em>price</em> the problem, in reality?
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>Oh look, some states:</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
The problem that we're seeing, is the increasing demand for gas
is predominantly in the southern states […].
Yet, we're not seeing the investment in supply, in those states.
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
But you just said, we're well supplied.
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
The cheapest gas is the gas that's close to the use
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>which is why we love sending it overseas</i>.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
So we
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>and this one is an inclusive we, which includes you the taxpayer</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
need to be building more supply, where it's needed.
[…]
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
[…]
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
[…] Alright. Well if more supply is the answer here,
one proposal being considered by the government,
is to let the three big LNG exporters
keep their international contracts in place,
no breaching of contracts,
but <em>excess</em> gas that's currently sold on the international spot market
would instead be made available in Australia first,
at a price of no more than $10 a gigajoule.
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
More than they were getting last year, so they still get a profit.
What's wrong with that idea?
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
David, that uncontracted gas is already being offered
to the domestic market first.
That was the basis of the heads of agreement […].
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
But at <em>very</em> high prices. But not at $10 a gigajoule,
it's being offered for more than that.
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Well let's just be clear on what these gas price caps would do.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
I know it sounds like a[n] easy and quick solution…
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Yep.
</p>
<p class="interview-host thought">
<i>And that yep isn't even one of these inserted thought bubbles!</i>
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
… but it's not that simple.
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Why not?
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Gas prices, gas price caps, would have… a chilling effect on
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>profit, and to a lesser extent</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
new investment.
It will undermine investment confidence in new supply,
it'll actually increase demand,
while creating structural shortages in supply,
which just creates further difficulties and problems long-term.
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Well, you talk about a chilling effect,
manufacturers are facing more than a chilling effect […].
That's spooking a lot of investors,
having to, you know, face double the gas price they were a year ago.
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Let's… when we're talking about gas prices,
let's just be clear, this is a complex market,
and gas pricing is complex
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>meaning profitable</i>.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
There's the retail market, and then there's the wholesale market.
Now, I'm going to, I'm focused on the wholesale market […].
And the realised average price, for gas sold in the wholesale market,
90% of which is sold under long-term contracts,
is priced between [$]6 and $12 a gigajoule.
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Well that was probably on contracts
written before this price spike though right?
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
That's the average price being realised, in third quarter this year.
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
[…] That's between July and September
and presumably contracts that pre-date what's happened with the gas price.
What's being offered now?
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
So David, this is where we need far more transparency in the market.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>Whoops. Did I just say that instead of
"we need <em>to be</em> far more transparent?"</i>
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Can't you tell us?
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Because we're seeing… well we're seeing, uh claims of…
of very high prices being offered in the market…
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Well don't you know?
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
… but there's no details around that.
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Why don't you know?
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
No, this is reported to the ACCC.
We'll get more details of this but there will be a delay.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>Suck shit, David.</i>
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Can you tell me how much, uh, have the profits of the LNG exporters grown,
since the war in Ukraine?
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
David, what I can tell you, is that the strong demand for our LNG exports,
is delivering returns for
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>us the gas industry, at the expensive of</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
Australian budgets and the Australian people.
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Well I'm asking about the profits for the companies though.
There are estimates it's around $26 billion in profit <em>growth</em>.
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
I don't have an estimate for individual companies,
they report this on a quarterly basis.
But what I can say, is that we're seeing more
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>which is a euphemism for fuck-all</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
returns to the Australian people in the budget […].
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
To be clear on that, the petroleum resource rent tax,
this financial year, is returning very little…
$2.6 billion, and that's barely moved from before the gas price spike.
So is that really fair given the sort of profits that are estimated
to be $26 billion in profit growth?
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
The petroleum resource rent tax is projected to provide $11 billion,
to the federal government budget, in the forward estimates…
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Over <em>four years</em>.
</p>
<p class="interview-host thought">
<i>Nice try. I'm not innumerate.</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
[…] What are profits over four years, if you want to use that figure?
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
This is already a profits-based tax
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>which you all ought to be grateful for</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
of at least 40%
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>of the excess of assessable receipts
over the deductible expenditure and transferred exploration expenditure</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
and it's just one aspect of the
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>measly</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
financial contribution of the industry to government revenues.
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Why can't you tell us the profits they're raking in?
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
…
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>How dare you leave me speechless for a few seconds!</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
… Look, I'm… I'm representing the industry, the… these are
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>allegedly tax-avoiding</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
international companies too of course, David,
but what I can tell you is the direct contribution that we're making,
to the Australian governments, and to Australian people,
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>whom we do shaft with glee,</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
will <em>triple</em> this year according to our estimates. […]
</p>
<img alt="David Speers:" src="david-speers-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
OK.
</p>
<p class="interview-host thought">
<i>But triple an infinitesimal amount is still infinitesimal.</i>
</p>
<img alt="Samantha McCulloch:" src="samantha-mcculloch-2022-11-03.jpg" class="interview-guest">

That includes royalties, it includes taxes, […].

<p class="interview-host">
Alright. Samantha McCulloch, we'll have to leave it there.
Thanks for joining us.
