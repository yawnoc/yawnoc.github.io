<div class="interview">

<p class="interview-host">
John Howard, welcome to 7.30.
</p>
<img alt="John Howard:" src="john-howard-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Thank you.
</p>
<img alt="Sarah Ferguson:" src="sarah-ferguson-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
In all your years as prime minister,
did you ever secretly appoint yourself to other ministries?
</p>
<img alt="John Howard:" src="john-howard-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
No, I didn't.
</p>
<img alt="Sarah Ferguson:" src="sarah-ferguson-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
We know Scott Morrison did it five times;
what possible justification could there be?
</p>
<img alt="John Howard:" src="john-howard-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Well that's a matter for him
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>which is an awfully diplomatic way of saying None, he's insane</i>.
</p>
<img alt="Sarah Ferguson:" src="sarah-ferguson-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Well, you're the former prime minister and a grandee of the partyâ€¦
</p>
<img alt="John Howard:" src="john-howard-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
That doesn't give me some special right
to pontificate on what some of my successors have done.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
Look, Scott Morrison has talked about this, he's contextualised it
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>with his I'm-Scomo-the-Messiah unlogic</i>,
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
and I think everybody, particularly the current Prime Minister,
should get on with the present and the future.
I say to MrÂ Albanese, stop behaving like an opposition leader.
You won the election; let's hear a bit of government from you.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>Shut up, Labor.</i>
</p>
<img alt="Sarah Ferguson:" src="sarah-ferguson-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Erm, perhaps your instincts as a senior Liberal are to protect the party,
[â€¦] but as both a conservative
and someone who believes in parliamentary conventions,
how big a breach was this?
</p>
<img alt="John Howard:" src="john-howard-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Look, I'm not going toâ€¦ pontificate
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>even though I look like one</i>.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
There are
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>stupid</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
reasons why he did it,
and part of the conservative tradition is to always understand
the context in which things occur
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>particularly when those things are poor decisions made by conservatives</i>.
</p>
<img alt="Sarah Ferguson:" src="sarah-ferguson-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
I don't think that belongs to the conservativesâ€¦
</p>
<img alt="John Howard:" src="john-howard-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
No, but it's not denied to the conservatives.
</p>
<img alt="Sarah Ferguson:" src="sarah-ferguson-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Indeed. But, as someone who has held that position,
can you conceive of such a thing,
of secretly appointing yourself to ministerial positions
without telling your colleagues?
</p>
<img alt="John Howard:" src="john-howard-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Sarah, good try,
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>i.e.Â screw you,</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
but look, I've indicated that it's a matter
for Scott to explain and contextualise.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
I think most people, and allow me the expression of this opinion,
most people
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>in the Liberal Party</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
are going to say,
"Well, that's interesting but let's get on with the present and the future."
</p>
<img alt="Sarah Ferguson:" src="sarah-ferguson-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
I think there's a number of people in your own party
who are calling on Scott Morrison to resign from parliament.
Should he at least do that?
</p>
<img alt="John Howard:" src="john-howard-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
No, I don't think he should do that.
Apart from anything else, it's not in the interests of the Liberal Party
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>even though it may well be in the interests of this country</i>
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
to have a by-election at the moment [â€¦],
so, if anybody cares about my party, the Liberal Party,
then the last thing they'll do is be requesting unwanted by-elections.
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
[â€¦]
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[â€¦]
</p>
<img alt="Sarah Ferguson:" src="sarah-ferguson-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Do you understand why the governor-general waved it through?
</p>
<img alt="John Howard:" src="john-howard-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
I don't think any criticism can be offered of the governor-general because,
there is on the face of it [â€¦] nothing illegal.
So in those circumstances, the true conservative principle
is that he should act on the advice of his ministers
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>(Morrison, Morrison, Morrison, Morrison, and Morrison)</i>.
</p>
<img alt="Sarah Ferguson:" src="sarah-ferguson-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
It's a legacy for your party however,
which is now in the process of tearing itself apart, to some degree.
</p>
<img alt="John Howard:" src="john-howard-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Now, I don't want to be combativeâ€¦
</p>
<img alt="Sarah Ferguson:" src="sarah-ferguson-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
No; nor do I, sir.
</p>
<img alt="John Howard:" src="john-howard-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
and I know you don't want to be combative,
but I thought we were going to talk aboutâ€¦
</p>
<img alt="Sarah Ferguson:" src="sarah-ferguson-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Mmm. There are <em>plenty</em> of things to talk about.
</p>
<img alt="John Howard:" src="john-howard-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
Yes I know, I know; well I don't want to be,
suggest[ing] for a <em>moment</em>,
that I have been got on this program under false pretences
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>except right nowÂ ðŸ˜ˆ</i>.
</p>
<img alt="Sarah Ferguson:" src="sarah-ferguson-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
No, we certainly asked you on this program to talk about [â€¦] your book,
but you would not deny me the opportunity to ask you an importantâ€¦
</p>
<img alt="John Howard:" src="john-howard-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
No, I don't deny because it's a very free countryâ€¦
</p>
<img alt="Sarah Ferguson:" src="sarah-ferguson-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
Indeed.
</p>
<img alt="John Howard:" src="john-howard-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
â€¦ but I can point out the sequence of events,
and I can give context to the questions that you're asking
</p>
<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>which are starting to irritate me ever so slightly</i>.
</p>
<p class="interview-host">
[â€¦]
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[â€¦]
</p>
<img alt="Sarah Ferguson:" src="sarah-ferguson-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
One thing you're very clear about in your book
is your disapproval for Donald Trump. [â€¦]
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
[â€¦]

<p class="interview-host">
[â€¦]
</p>
<img alt="John Howard:" src="john-howard-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-guest">
<p class="interview-guest">
[â€¦]
My attitude to Donald Trump has been set in stone
by his behaviour after he lost.
</p>
<p class="interview-guest">
Part of democracy is to accept results [â€¦].
I didn't like losing in 2007, but I didn't carry on that I'd been cheated,
and no doubt Paul Keating didn't like losing to me in '96
but <em>he</em> didn't say he'd been cheated.
</p>
<img alt="Sarah Ferguson:" src="sarah-ferguson-2022-08-16.jpg" class="interview-host">
<p class="interview-host">
And it didn't turn out that you'd appointed yourself
to numerous ministries at the same time.

<p class="interview-guest thought">
<i>Dammit, I was going to make the closing remark.</i>

<p class="interview-host">
MrÂ Howard, that's all we have time for this evening
but thank you very much indeed for joining us.
