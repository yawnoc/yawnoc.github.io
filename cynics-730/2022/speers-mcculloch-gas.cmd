  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Samantha McCulloch is the chief executive of the
  Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association,
  which represents gas producers.
  --
  --{.interview-host}
  Samantha McCulloch, welcome to the program.
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Thanks for having me David.
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  So the industry minister says the problem with gas prices right now
  is "a glut of greed" by the gas companies. Is he right?
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _Oh, what a direct question! But first, talking points:_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  David what we're seeing is high energy prices across the globe.
  This is the result of a global energy crisis,
  triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  It's affecting all energy sources, and it's affecting all countries.
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  But can you explain to me,
  why that should push up the price of *Australian* gas, in Australia?
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  We're seeing
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _specifically ogling, and salivating at_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  very strong demand for gas domestically. [...]
  It's increasing demand for gas that's driving up these prices,
  as well as of course international pressures.
  And the key to driving down these prices [...] is increasing supply.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  That's what the industry is seeking to do,
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _within the constraints of maximising profit,_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  but we need a clear runway, for more investment,
  to boost supply, and put downward pressure on prices.
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Well, OK but you did say a few days ago yourself,
  "The domestic market is well supplied."
  And the agreement that was struck only just over a month ago
  [...] was about boosting supply [...].
  Supply doesn't appear to be the problem does it?
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  The gas industry is committed, to supplying
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _at exorbitant prices_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  the domestic market, and the domestic market has been well supplied.
  The heads of agreement that were struck [...]
  committed to ensuring adequate supply for the domestic market.
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  So what's the problem with supply? Is *price* the problem, in reality?
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _Oh look, some states:_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  The problem that we're seeing, is the increasing demand for gas
  is predominantly in the southern states [...].
  Yet, we're not seeing the investment in supply, in those states.
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  But you just said, we're well supplied.
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  The cheapest gas is the gas that's close to the use
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _which is why we love sending it overseas_.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  So we
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _and this one is an inclusive we, which includes you the taxpayer_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  need to be building more supply, where it's needed.
  [...]
  --

  --{.interview-host}
  [...]
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  [...] Alright. Well if more supply is the answer here,
  one proposal being considered by the government,
  is to let the three big LNG exporters
  keep their international contracts in place,
  no breaching of contracts,
  but *excess* gas that's currently sold on the international spot market
  would instead be made available in Australia first,
  at a price of no more than $10 a gigajoule.
  --
  --{.interview-host}
  More than they were getting last year, so they still get a profit.
  What's wrong with that idea?
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  David, that uncontracted gas is already being offered
  to the domestic market first.
  That was the basis of the heads of agreement [...].
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  But at *very* high prices. But not at $10 a gigajoule,
  it's being offered for more than that.
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well let's just be clear on what these gas price caps would do.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  I know it sounds like a[n] easy and quick solution...
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Yep.
  --
  --{.interview-host .thought}
  _And that yep isn't even one of these inserted thought bubbles!_
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  ... but it's not that simple.
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Why not?
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Gas prices, gas price caps, would have... a chilling effect on
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _profit, and to a lesser extent_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  new investment.
  It will undermine investment confidence in new supply,
  it'll actually increase demand,
  while creating structural shortages in supply,
  which just creates further difficulties and problems long-term.
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Well, you talk about a chilling effect,
  manufacturers are facing more than a chilling effect [...].
  That's spooking a lot of investors,
  having to, you know, face double the gas price they were a year ago.
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Let's... when we're talking about gas prices,
  let's just be clear, this is a complex market,
  and gas pricing is complex
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _meaning profitable_.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  There's the retail market, and then there's the wholesale market.
  Now, I'm going to, I'm focused on the wholesale market [...].
  And the realised average price, for gas sold in the wholesale market,
  90% of which is sold under long-term contracts,
  is priced between [$]6 and $12 a gigajoule.
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Well that was probably on contracts
  written before this price spike though right?
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  That's the average price being realised, in third quarter this year.
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  [...] That's between July and September
  and presumably contracts that pre-date what's happened with the gas price.
  What's being offered now?
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  So David, this is where we need far more transparency in the market.
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _Whoops. Did I just say that instead of
  "we need *to be* far more transparent?"_
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Can't you tell us?
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Because we're seeing... well we're seeing, uh claims of...
  of very high prices being offered in the market...
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Well don't you know?
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  ... but there's no details around that.
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Why don't you know?
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  No, this is reported to the ACCC.
  We'll get more details of this but there will be a delay.
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _Suck shit, David._
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Can you tell me how much, uh, have the profits of the LNG exporters grown,
  since the war in Ukraine?
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  David, what I can tell you, is that the strong demand for our LNG exports,
  is delivering returns for
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _us the gas industry, at the expensive of_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  Australian budgets and the Australian people.
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Well I'm asking about the profits for the companies though.
  There are estimates it's around $26~billion in profit *growth*.
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  I don't have an estimate for individual companies,
  they report this on a quarterly basis.
  But what I can say, is that we're seeing more
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _which is a euphemism for fuck-all_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  returns to the Australian people in the budget [...].
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  To be clear on that, the petroleum resource rent tax,
  this financial year, is returning very little...
  $2.6~billion, and that's barely moved from before the gas price spike.
  So is that really fair given the sort of profits that are estimated
  to be $26~billion in profit growth?
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  The petroleum resource rent tax is projected to provide $11~billion,
  to the federal government budget, in the forward estimates...
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Over *four years*.
  --
  --{.interview-host .thought}
  _Nice try. I'm not innumerate._
  --
  --{.interview-host}
  [...] What are profits over four years, if you want to use that figure?
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  This is already a profits-based tax
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _which you all ought to be grateful for_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  of at least 40%
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _of the excess of assessable receipts
  over the deductible expenditure and transferred exploration expenditure_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  and it's just one aspect of the
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _measly_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  financial contribution of the industry to government revenues.
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Why can't you tell us the profits they're raking in?
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  ...
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _How dare you leave me speechless for a few seconds!_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  ... Look, I'm... I'm representing the industry, the... these are
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _allegedly tax-avoiding_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  international companies too of course, David,
  but what I can tell you is the direct contribution that we're making,
  to the Australian governments, and to Australian people,
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _whom we do shaft with glee,_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  will *triple* this year according to our estimates. [...]
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  OK.
  --
  --{.interview-host .thought}
  _But triple an infinitesimal amount is still infinitesimal._
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  That includes royalties, it includes taxes, [...].
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --

  ![David Speers:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Alright. Samantha McCulloch, we'll have to leave it there.
  Thanks for joining us.
  --

  ![Samantha McCulloch:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Thank you David.
