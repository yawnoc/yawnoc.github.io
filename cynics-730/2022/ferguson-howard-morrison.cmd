  ![Sarah Ferguson:]
  --{.interview-host}
  John Howard, welcome to 7.30.
  --

  ![John Howard:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Thank you.
  --

  ![Sarah Ferguson:]
  --{.interview-host}
  In all your years as prime minister,
  did you ever secretly appoint yourself to other ministries?
  --

  ![John Howard:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  No, I didn't.
  --

  ![Sarah Ferguson:]
  --{.interview-host}
  We know Scott Morrison did it five times;
  what possible justification could there be?
  --

  ![John Howard:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Well that's a matter for him
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _which is an awfully diplomatic way of saying None, he's insane_.
  --

  ![Sarah Ferguson:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Well, you're the former prime minister and a grandee of the party...
  --

  ![John Howard:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  That doesn't give me some special right
  to pontificate on what some of my successors have done.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  Look, Scott Morrison has talked about this, he's contextualised it
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _with his I'm-Scomo-the-Messiah unlogic_,
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  and I think everybody, particularly the current Prime Minister,
  should get on with the present and the future.
  I say to Mr~Albanese, stop behaving like an opposition leader.
  You won the election; let's hear a bit of government from you.
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _Shut up, Labor._
  --

  ![Sarah Ferguson:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Erm, perhaps your instincts as a senior Liberal are to protect the party,
  [...] but as both a conservative
  and someone who believes in parliamentary conventions,
  how big a breach was this?
  --

  ![John Howard:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Look, I'm not going to... pontificate
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _even though I look like one_.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  There are
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _stupid_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  reasons why he did it,
  and part of the conservative tradition is to always understand
  the context in which things occur
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _particularly when those things are poor decisions made by conservatives_.
  --

  ![Sarah Ferguson:]
  --{.interview-host}
  I don't think that belongs to the conservatives...
  --

  ![John Howard:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  No, but it's not denied to the conservatives.
  --

  ![Sarah Ferguson:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Indeed. But, as someone who has held that position,
  can you conceive of such a thing,
  of secretly appointing yourself to ministerial positions
  without telling your colleagues?
  --

  ![John Howard:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Sarah, good try,
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _i.e.~screw you,_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  but look, I've indicated that it's a matter
  for Scott to explain and contextualise.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  I think most people, and allow me the expression of this opinion,
  most people
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _in the Liberal Party_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  are going to say,
  "Well, that's interesting but let's get on with the present and the future."
  --

  ![Sarah Ferguson:]
  --{.interview-host}
  I think there's a number of people in your own party
  who are calling on Scott Morrison to resign from parliament.
  Should he at least do that?
  --

  ![John Howard:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  No, I don't think he should do that.
  Apart from anything else, it's not in the interests of the Liberal Party
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _even though it may well be in the interests of this country_
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  to have a by-election at the moment [...],
  so, if anybody cares about my party, the Liberal Party,
  then the last thing they'll do is be requesting unwanted by-elections.
  --

  --{.interview-host}
  [...]
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --

  ![Sarah Ferguson:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Do you understand why the governor-general waved it through?
  --

  ![John Howard:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  I don't think any criticism can be offered of the governor-general because,
  there is on the face of it [...] nothing illegal.
  So in those circumstances, the true conservative principle
  is that he should act on the advice of his ministers
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _(Morrison, Morrison, Morrison, Morrison, and Morrison)._
  --

  ![Sarah Ferguson:]
  --{.interview-host}
  It's a legacy for your party however,
  which is now in the process of tearing itself apart, to some degree.
  --

  ![John Howard:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Now, I don't want to be combative...
  --

  ![Sarah Ferguson:]
  --{.interview-host}
  No; nor do I, sir.
  --

  ![John Howard:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  and I know you don't want to be combative,
  but I thought we were going to talk about...
  --

  ![Sarah Ferguson:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Mmm. There are *plenty* of things to talk about.
  --

  ![John Howard:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  Yes I know, I know; well I don't want to be,
  suggest[ing] for a *moment*,
  that I have been got on this program under false pretences
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _except right now~😈._
  --

  ![Sarah Ferguson:]
  --{.interview-host}
  No, we certainly asked you on this program to talk about [...] your book,
  but you would not deny me the opportunity to ask you an important...
  --

  ![John Howard:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  No, I don't deny because it's a very free country...
  --

  ![Sarah Ferguson:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Indeed.
  --

  ![John Howard:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  ... but I can point out the sequence of events,
  and I can give context to the questions that you're asking
  --
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _which are starting to irritate me ever so slightly._
  --

  --{.interview-host}
  [...]
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --

  ![Sarah Ferguson:]
  --{.interview-host}
  One thing you're very clear about in your book
  is your disapproval for Donald Trump. [...]
  --

  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  --
  --{.interview-host}
  [...]
  --

  ![John Howard:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  [...]
  My attitude to Donald Trump has been set in stone
  by his behaviour after he lost.
  --
  --{.interview-guest}
  Part of democracy is to accept results [...].
  I didn't like losing in 2007, but I didn't carry on that I'd been cheated,
  and no doubt Paul Keating didn't like losing to me in '96
  but *he* didn't say he'd been cheated.
  --

  ![Sarah Ferguson:]
  --{.interview-host}
  And it didn't turn out that you'd appointed yourself
  to numerous ministries at the same time.
  --

  ![John Howard:]
  --{.interview-guest .thought}
  _Dammit, I was going to make the closing remark._
  --

  ![Sarah Ferguson:]
  --{.interview-host}
  Mr~Howard, that's all we have time for this evening
  but thank you very much indeed for joining us.
  --

  ![John Howard:]
  --{.interview-guest}
  ::{style="font-size: small"} Thank you.::
