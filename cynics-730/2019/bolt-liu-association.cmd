**Wake up Australia.** \+
It is not racist or xenophobic to question
potential links to the Chinese Communist Party. \+
Race and place of origin are irrelevant.

  ----{.h}
  Gladys, thank you so much for your time.
  ----
  ----{.h}
  Can I just start: were you on the committee of
  two chapters of the China Overseas Exchange Association:
  one in Guangdong, from between 2003 and 2015, and the other in Shandong?
  ----
  
  \gladys-liu
  ----{.g}
  Well, good to be with you Andrew.
  ----
  ----{.g}
  I can tell you that, I cannot recall, as is reported,
  that from 2003 to 2015, twelve years long, that if I can't recall,
  I can't be an active member of that council, can I.
  ----
  ----{.gt}
  {However, my memory shall be magically restored within the next 24~hours,
  and I shall release a [statement] tomorrow, Wednesday the 11th,
  confirming that I was a member of the
  Guangdong Overseas Exchange Association in~2011.}

  You've been Honorary President also,
  of the Australia Jiangmen General Commerce Association.
  It has backed China's theft of the South China Sea.
  Was your Association wrong to support that theft?

  \gladys-liu

  Well, as the Honorary President of the organisation,
  that they didn't tell me everything that they do
  [...] they want to use your fame,
  they want you to attend their functions,
  [...] to lift the profile of their organisation and their event.
  ----
  ----{.g}
  Definitely, there was no information to me, what they do day to day,
  and I have no knowledge [...].

  {So there I was in an honorary leadersip role,
  happy to attend their functions and lift their profile,
  and content with them exploiting my name, in return for having
  absolutely no knowledge of the actual operations of the Association;
  what the hell was I even doing there, and how naive/stupid can I be eh?}

  Can I just end by just asking you a couple of things:
  Xi Jinping has made himself dictator for life;
  he is cracking down on dissidents, human rights activists;
  he has imprisoned Christians;
  he has imprisoned Uyghurs in re-education camps;
  he's threatening Taiwan;
  do your consider Xi Jinping a dictator?

  Gladys, excuse me. You were born in Hong Kong;
  at the moment you have seen in your home place,
  people in their millions at times, 1.7 million, in their millions,
  protesting against what China's doing there,
  and you don't have any opinion on Xi Jinping?
  ----
  
  \gladys-liu
  ----{.g}
  OK. [...] In terms of Hong Kong,
  it is very very sad for anyone to see what has happened
  ----
  ----{.gt}
  {which, depending on who you're talking to, translates to either
  (a)~"it's sad, there is no hope for HK people anymore...
  2047 is really coming..."
  or
  (b)~"it's sad, this violence and smashing stuff up...
  but [those comrades who blew children up in 1967][1967]:
  they were heroes of the Glorious Motherland!
  Do you hear me? Heroes!"}

  That is not a question for me to answer.

  I don't want to know about Hong Kong; I'm asking you about Xi Jinping,
  the dictator of Communist China, and you don't have an opinion about him?

  I do have an opinion, but I'm not going to use the word "dictator"
