<h2>Energy Minister Angus Taylor discusses Snowy Hydro 2.0</h2>
<div class="interview">
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="host">
Minister, thanks for your time.
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Thanks for having me, Leigh.
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="host">
Why wasn't a cost benefit analysis done of Snowy 2.0
before it was commissioned?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well… it has been done
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{which, I know, doesn't answer your question,
but I've got a bunch of talking points to get through first}.
</p>
<p class="guest">
I mean, we know that the benefits of Snowy 2.0
will be from [$]4.4&nbsp;to 6.8&nbsp;billion
and […] Snowy will reduce volatility of wholesale electricity prices.
</p>
<p class="guest">
It will put downward pressure on prices […].
</p>
<p class="guest">
And what makes this possible […]
is the record levels of investment […] in solar and wind,
and Snowy works as a big battery.
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="host">
But Minister, this analysis wasn't done
before the Snowy scheme was announced.
How is it responsible use of […] money […]
to announce a massive infrastructure spend
without doing a feasibility study first?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Leigh, we made our investment decision
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{to stick with Malcolm Turnbull's announcement,
which he made in March 2017 before the feasibility study was conducted,}
</p>
<p class="guest">
after we'd done a cost benefit, and after we'd done the feasibility work.
Now the feasibility work was done in December 2017 […].
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…] By storing energy, [Snowy] can bring down the prices
and […] reduce the volatility of those prices.
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="host">
On that point, if Snowy 2.0 comes online in 2025,
how much in percentage terms
will the average household power bill go down by?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{I have no idea. Dodge the first:}
</p>
<p class="guest">
Well, it depends on the time of day and […] year
but at peak times of year it can come down by
thousands of dollars a megawatt hour.
</p>
<p class="guest">
And to put this again into perspective, we know that at peak times of…
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="host">
But that— sorry to interrupt you […],
I don't know what a megawatt hour is when I look at my power bill.
I just want to know:
by what percentage is my power bill going to come down by?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{I have no idea. Dodge the second:}
</p>
<p class="guest">
Well yeah the benefits across all Australians is [$]4.4&nbsp;[billion],
as I say $4.4&nbsp;to $6.8&nbsp;billion, and that's a very significant…
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="host">
No but that doesn't mean anything to me,
because my bill's in hundreds of dollars,
so what does my bill go down by?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{I have no idea. Dodge the third:}
</p>
<p class="guest">
It depends on how much you're spending now
but we're talking, uh you know, very… significant amounts
for businesses, for industry and for households.
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{And no, I am unable to quantify "significant"
because I am using it as a rhetorical device.}
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="host">
Why has Snowy 2.0 doubled in cost
and blown out significantly in terms of time?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well, it hasn't
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{but only if you ignore Malcolm Turnbull's initial quote of $2&nbsp;billion
and 4&nbsp;years, which I sense is the whole point of your question}.
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="host">
Well, it has. Malcolm Turnbull said it was going to be 4&nbsp;years originally?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{Bugger.}
</p>
<p class="guest">
The original feasibility…
the feasibility study work was done in December 2017.
The numbers were [$]3.8&nbsp;to [$]4.5&nbsp;billion and we're in line with those.
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{Of course, "in line" has a different meaning
if we are referring to spending by Labor.}
</p>
<p class="guest">
The commissioning will be done in 2024 to 2025, and they were numbers,
they were times that were established during the feasibility work.
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{Gee, it's so convenient just ignoring Malcolm Turnbull's numbers eh?}
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="host">
Australians were originally told it would cost $2&nbsp;billion,
then less than a year later that doubled.
Earlier this year a contract for part of it was signed
for more than $5&nbsp;billion.
</p>
<p class="host">
Is there a limit to what the Government will chip in?
Is it not a blank cheque because […]
[it is] key policy and therefore it has to happen?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="guest">
No, Leigh, the decision was made based on
the feasibility study in December 2017.
</p>
<p class="guest">
They were the numbers that count,
and the numbers are still in line with that feasibility study.
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{Since we are talking about the Coalition,
"in line" means if you squint hard enough, they look the same.
Never mind that $5&nbsp;billion already exceeds the $4.5&nbsp;billion
quoted by the feasibility study.}
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="host">
And is there an upper limit to what the Government will chip in?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well, we intend to achieve the outcomes of the feasibility study
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{but after all, that's <em>intent</em>, so the answer is 'no'}.
</p>
<p class="guest">
That's the plan and I'm assured by the Snowy chief executive and board
that we will achieve those outcomes.
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="host">
The CEO of Snowy Hydro, Paul Broad, says that
because of the amount of government money being spent,
Australians are either going to have to pay for this
through their taxes or through their bills.
Which will it be?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well, the truth of the matter is,
it's going to reduce bills by $4.4&nbsp;to $6.8&nbsp;billion.
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="host">
So does that mean that we'll be paying for it through our taxes?
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="guest">
And the reason… Well the rea… Well, no.
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{In other words, I am disagreeing with Paul Broad,
whose assurances were enough to satisfy me a few moments ago
regarding achieving outcomes of the feasibility study.
And cue spiel about reducing volatility:}
</p>
<p class="guest">
I mean, the reason there is an opportunity
to deliver a better outcome for consumers is very simple.
</p>
<p class="guest">
Right now, Leigh, we are seeing huge volatility in electricity prices
[…].
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="host">
But minister, we're talking about government spending
of a massive scale […].
Where does the money come from? It's got to come from somewhere.
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well, the money comes from…
the investment is being made by the Government—
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{Whoops, did I say "Government"?
"Government" is a euphemism for "taxpayer".}
</p>
<p class="guest">
$1.38&nbsp;billion in equity investment […].
</p>
<p class="host">
[…]
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="host">
Minister, I'm sure you've got Cabinet tonight.
Thank you very much for making time to squeeze us in.
</p>
<img alt="ANGUS TAYLOR" class="guest" src="angus-taylor-2019-10-14.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Thanks for having me, Leigh.
