<strong>Wake up Australia.</strong><br>
It is not racist or xenophobic to question

Race and place of origin are irrelevant.

<p class="host">
Gladys, thank you so much for your time.
</p>
<p class="host">
Can I just start: were you on the committee of
two chapters of the China Overseas Exchange Association:
one in Guangdong, from between 2003 and 2015, and the other in Shandong?
</p>
<img alt="GLADYS LIU" class="guest" src="gladys-liu-2019-09-10.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well, good to be with you Andrew.
</p>
<p class="guest">
I can tell you that, I cannot recall, as is reported,
that from 2003 to 2015, twelve years long, that if I can't recall,
I can't be an active member of that council, can I.
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{However, my memory shall be magically restored within the next 24&nbsp;hours,
and I shall release a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-11/gladys-liu-admits-to-association-with-guangdong-association/11501088">statement</a> tomorrow, Wednesday the 11th,
confirming that I was a member of the
Guangdong Overseas Exchange Association in&nbsp;2011.}

You've been Honorary President also,
of the Australia Jiangmen General Commerce Association.
It has backed China's theft of the South China Sea.
Was your Association wrong to support that theft?
</p>
<img alt="GLADYS LIU" class="guest" src="gladys-liu-2019-09-10.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well, as the Honorary President of the organisation,
that they didn't tell me everything that they do
[…] they want to use your fame,
they want you to attend their functions,
[…] to lift the profile of their organisation and their event.
</p>
<p class="guest">
Definitely, there was no information to me, what they do day to day,
and I have no knowledge […].
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{So there I was in an honorary leadersip role,
happy to attend their functions and lift their profile,
and content with them exploiting my name, in return for having
absolutely no knowledge of the actual operations of the Association;
what the hell was I even doing there, and how naive/stupid can I be eh?}

[…] Can I just hear, you were also Honorary President of the
United Chinese Commerce Association.
Now there is evidence that this too is connected to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Front_Work_Department">United Front (Work Department)</a>:
true or not?
</p>
<img alt="GLADYS LIU" class="guest" src="gladys-liu-2019-09-10.jpg">

What is that organisation again? I don't think I am. […]

<img alt="ANDREW BOLT" class="host" src="andrew-bolt-2019-09-10.jpg">

You have been Honorary President of the United Chinese Commerce Association
and you've forgotten that as well.

Can you now tell us, in what way should Australia
be more friendly to China? Can you give some examples?

Well… that is what our Foreign Minister has been doing very well,
and she has been looking at the relationship between all countries,
and she has been talking for the interests of Australia with other
Foreign Ministers.

"the interests of Australia's government".}

Can I just end by just asking you a couple of things:
Xi Jinping has made himself dictator for life;
he is cracking down on dissidents, human rights activists;
he has imprisoned Christians;
he has imprisoned Uyghurs in re-education camps;
he's threatening Taiwan;
do your consider Xi Jinping a dictator?

<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{Eep!}

Umm… well honestly I have been focusing on serving the seat of Chisholm
[…] I don't really know and I don't really…

<img alt="ANDREW BOLT" class="host" src="andrew-bolt-2019-09-10.jpg">
<p class="host">
Gladys, excuse me. You were born in Hong Kong;
at the moment you have seen in your home place,
people in their millions at times, 1.7 million, in their millions,
protesting against what China's doing there,
and you don't have any opinion on Xi Jinping?
</p>
<img alt="GLADYS LIU" class="guest" src="gladys-liu-2019-09-10.jpg">
<p class="guest">
OK. […] In terms of Hong Kong,
it is very very sad for anyone to see what has happened
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{which, depending on who you're talking to, translates to either
(a)&nbsp;"it's sad, there is no hope for HK people anymore…
2047 is really coming…"
or
(b)&nbsp;"it's sad, this violence and smashing stuff up…
but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_1967_leftist_riots">those comrades who blew children up in 1967</a>:
they were heroes of the Glorious Motherland!
Do you hear me? Heroes!"}
</p>
<img alt="ANDREW BOLT" class="host" src="andrew-bolt-2019-09-10.jpg">
<p class="host">
But Gladys, simple question: is Xi Jinping a dictator?
</p>
<img alt="GLADYS LIU" class="guest" src="gladys-liu-2019-09-10.jpg">
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{Eep!!}
</p>
<p class="guest">
That is not a question for me to answer.
But I can tell you about Hong Kong, it is very very sad to see…
</p>
<img alt="ANDREW BOLT" class="host" src="andrew-bolt-2019-09-10.jpg">
<p class="host">
I don't want to know about Hong Kong; I'm asking you about Xi Jinping,
the dictator of Communist China, and you don't have an opinion about him?
</p>
<img alt="GLADYS LIU" class="guest" src="gladys-liu-2019-09-10.jpg">
<p class="guest">
I do have an opinion, but I'm not going to use the word "dictator"
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{because, having joined the Australian government,
I am now obliged to cower in submission
and not offend the Communist Party,
because money}.
</p>
<p class="guest">
He is, in their system, an elected Chairman, or President,
they call it, for China.
</p>
<img alt="ANDREW BOLT" class="host" src="andrew-bolt-2019-09-10.jpg">
<p class="host">
Gladys Liu, are you, in effect, a spokesman
for the Chinese Communist regime in Australia?
</p>
<img alt="GLADYS LIU" class="guest" src="gladys-liu-2019-09-10.jpg">
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{Aren't we all, except Andrew Hastie and a few others?}
</p>
<p class="guest">
The simple answer is no. As I said…
</p>
<img alt="ANDREW BOLT" class="host" src="andrew-bolt-2019-09-10.jpg">
<p class="host">
Gladys Liu, thank you so much indeed for your time.
</p>
<img alt="GLADYS LIU" class="guest" src="gladys-liu-2019-09-10.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Thank you Andrew.
