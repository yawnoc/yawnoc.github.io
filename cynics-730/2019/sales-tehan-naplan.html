<h2>Education Minister Dan Tehan discusses NAPLAN and the latest results.</h2>
<div class="interview">
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-08-28.jpg">
<p class="host">
Minister thanks for joining us.
</p>
<img alt="DAN TEHAN" class="guest" src="dan-tehan-2019-08-28.jpg">
<p class="guest">
It's a pleasure Leigh.
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-08-28.jpg">
<p class="host">
Federal Government spending on education
has increased by $20&nbsp;billion during the past decade,
with little improvement in results if you look at the NAPLAN outcomes:
why?
</p>
<img alt="DAN TEHAN" class="guest" src="dan-tehan-2019-08-28.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well, I think it's important for us to understand that
it's not just about money
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{which I'm saying because NAPLAN evidently isn't going so well}.
</p>
<p class="guest">
Obviously money is important
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{which I'm saying so that I can quote myself
if Labor attacks us on education spending,
and also in case NAPLAN miraculously becomes good later on},
</p>
<p class="guest">
but with that, also has to come reform […]
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…] and as we roll this out,
my hope is that we will start to see an uplift in the NAPLAN results.
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{How good are miracles, eh?}
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-08-28.jpg">
<p class="host">
But you say "as we roll this out"…
you've been in government for six years now.
</p>
<img alt="DAN TEHAN" class="guest" src="dan-tehan-2019-08-28.jpg">
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{Oh yeah… umm… time for a casual deflection…}
</p>
<p class="guest">
That's right
and it takes a while to get all the states and territories onboard. […]
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-08-28.jpg">
<p class="host">
The three biggest states, Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales,
are all reviewing NAPLAN.
Is it a matter of time until it's overhauled or dumped?
</p>
<img alt="DAN TEHAN" class="guest" src="dan-tehan-2019-08-28.jpg">
<p class="guest">
So […] we're transitioning NAPLAN from pen and paper to online. […]
It might take us two years, but our hope is that we can get that done
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{and this is the same kind of hope as I mentioned before,
regarding uplift in results}.
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…] once we've got NAPLAN fully online,
it will be time to have a look at NAPLAN and say:
"OK. How can we make it fit for purpose for the next 5–10 years?"
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{I mean, NAPLAN's totally fit for purpose right now, isn't it?}
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-08-28.jpg">
<p class="host thought-bubble">
{Mmm…}
</p>
<p class="host">
On that point about online,
the last round of tests were marred by computer glitches.
Are you confident in what the test results are actually showing,
and do they match your sense of what you see anecdotally […]?
</p>
<img alt="DAN TEHAN" class="guest" src="dan-tehan-2019-08-28.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Yes. All the advice that I'm getting is that the results are comparable,
and that's come from the experts
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{thank God for them}
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…] and […] the feedback that I'm getting,
especially when it comes from parents is, that they like NAPLAN
[…] because they get a sense as to
where their child's at with their education.
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-08-28.jpg">
<p class="host">
But people were told,
"Swallow your concerns about, say, pressure on children
[…], because NAPLAN will help lead to
significant improvements in student outcomes."
If it hasn't done that so far, then why keep going with it?
</p>
<img alt="DAN TEHAN" class="guest" src="dan-tehan-2019-08-28.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well, […] the reason we know that we're getting
a mixed performance when it comes to NAPLAN
is because students are undertaking it
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{…so if NAPLAN didn't exist then
we wouldn't know how bad it is?}
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-08-28.jpg">
<p class="host">
[…] The Chancellor of the University of Queensland Peter Varghese
raised this question this week, of:
"What proportion of the student population can be international,
before you fundamentally change the character of a university?"
</p>
<p class="host">
Is it a third? A half? Three quarters?
What do you think is the answer to that?
</p>
<img alt="DAN TEHAN" class="guest" src="dan-tehan-2019-08-28.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well can I say, I'm very pleased that Peter Varghese as a Chancellor
is raising this question
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{so that I don't have to}
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…] and it's something that […] [university] councils should be asking.
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-08-28.jpg">
<p class="host thought-bubble">
{Well can't you just answer the question?}
</p>
<p class="host">
But as the Minister, I'm asking you what do you think?
A quarter? A half?
</p>
<img alt="DAN TEHAN" class="guest" src="dan-tehan-2019-08-28.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Well Leigh, it varies
</p>
<p class="guest thought-bubble">
{because I don't want to piss off
people who are filling university coffers,
the contents of which eventually flow on into our coffers}.
</p>
<p class="guest">
[…]
</p>
<img alt="LEIGH SALES" class="host" src="leigh-sales-2019-08-28.jpg">
<p class="host">
Minister, thanks for speaking to us.
</p>
<img alt="DAN TEHAN" class="guest" src="dan-tehan-2019-08-28.jpg">
<p class="guest">
Pleasure Leigh.
