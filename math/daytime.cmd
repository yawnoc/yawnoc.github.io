----
Approximations must be made, that this problem be doable.
In roughly decreasing order of accuracy (according to my gut):
----

++++
1.
  The size of the observer is negligible compared to the size of the earth.

2.
  The difference between a [tropical year (or solar year)] [tropical year]
  and a [sidereal year] is negligible,
  i.e.~Earth's [axial precession] is negligible.

3.
  The radius of the earth is negligible compared to the earth--sun distance.

4.
  The earth is spherical.

5.
  The earth's orbit around the sun is circular (and hence uniform in speed).

6.
  The linear angle subtended by the sun in the sky is negligible,
  i.e.~the sun is taken to be a point.

7.
  Light propagates in straight lines, i.e.~no atmospheric refraction.
  
++++

----
The last assumption of no refraction is the weakest,
usually affecting sunrise and sunset times by several minutes.
Later on I give a first-order correction to account for this.

##{#sun}
  Sun's position
##


----
Let $t$ be the __time__ since the northern spring (or March) equinox.
The sun goes once around the ecliptic every __solar year~(yr)__,
equal to 365.242~days.
Defining what I call the __year angle__
----
$$
  Y = \frac{2 \pi t}{\unit{yr}},
$$
----
which moves through a full turn each solar year,
the sun's position is therefore given in ecliptic coordinates by
----
$$
  (\tilde{x}, \tilde{y}, \tilde{z})_\mathrm{sun} =
  (R_\mathrm{es} \cos Y, R_\mathrm{es} \sin Y, 0),
$$
----
where $R_\mathrm{es}$ is the earth--sun distance.
----
----
In the northern hemisphere,
$Y = 0\degree, 90\degree, 180\degree, 270\degree$ correspond to
spring equinox~(春分), summer solstice~(夏至),
autumnal equinox~(秋分), and winter solstice~(冬至) respectively.
----


##{#observer}
  Observer's position
##


----
We consider an observer at latitude $\delta$ measured north from the equator.
In equatorial spherical coordinates, the observer has radius
$r_\mathrm{obs} = R_\mathrm{e}$ (the radius of the earth)
and zenith angle $\theta_\mathrm{obs} = \pi/2 - \delta$.
----

----
Now a mean __solar day~(day)__, 24~hours,
is the time it takes for the earth to spin once relative to the sun,
whereas a __sidereal day~(sd)__
is the time it takes for the earth to spin once relative to the fixed stars.
Since the sun revolves once around the ecliptic every solar year,
the number of sidereal days per year is
one more than the number of solar days:
----
$$
  \begin{gathered}
    \frac{\unit{yr}}{\unit{sd}} = 1 + \frac{\unit{yr}}{\unit{day}}
      \\[\tallspace]
    \unit{sd}
    = \frac{\unit{yr}}{1 + \unit{yr} / {\unit{day}}}
    = \frac{365.242 \times 24 \unit{hr}}{1 + 365.242}
    = 23 \unit{hr} \, 56' \, 4''.
  \end{gathered}
$$

----
Therefore you would be correct in saying that
the observer's azimuthal angle is $\phi_\mathrm{obs} = 2 \pi t / {\unit{sd}}$,
which moves through a full turn every sidereal day.
However, I won't be doing this.
Instead, I shall use the fact that a day (whether solar or sidereal)
is much shorter than a year, so that over the course of a day,
the year angle $Y$ is almost constant
(it only changes by order $\unit{day} / {\unit{yr}} = 1 / 365.242 = 0.3\%$).
----

||||{.important}
Thus, to make the maths simpler, I shall assert that
$Y$ actually is constant over a day,
and compensate for the associated error by instead putting
$\phi_\mathrm{obs} = 2 \pi t / {\unit{day}}$.
You may doubt me if you like, but my intuition says that this will work.
||||

----
Defining what I call the __day angle__
----
$$
  D = \frac{2 \pi t}{\unit{day}}
$$
----
which moves through a full turn every solar day,
the observer's position is given in equatorial spherical coordinates by
----
$$
  (r, \theta, \phi)_\mathrm{obs} =
  (R_\mathrm{e}, \pi/2 - \delta, D).
$$


##{#direction}
  Direction from the observer to the sun
##


----
Moving the sun's position
from ecliptic $(\tilde{x}, \tilde{y}, \tilde{z})$ coordinates
to equatorial $(x, y, z)$ coordinates, we obtain
----
$$
  \begin{pmatrix}
    x \\ y \\ z
  \end{pmatrix}_\mathrm{sun}
  =
  R_\mathrm{es}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos Y \\ \cos\tau \sin Y \\ \sin\tau \sin Y
  \end{pmatrix}.
$$

----
Now the distance from the origin to the observer
is the earth's radius $R_\mathrm{e}$,
and by assumption this is infinitesimally small
compared to the earth--sun distance $R_\mathrm{es}$.
Thus the direction (or unit vector) from the observer towards the sun is
----
$$
  \vec{u} = u_x \basisvec{x} + u_y \basisvec{y} + u_z \basisvec{z},
$$
----
  where
----
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    u_x &= \cos Y \\
    u_y &= \cos\tau \sin Y \\
    u_z &= \sin\tau \sin Y,
  \end{aligned}
$$
----
and $\basisvec{x}, \basisvec{y}, \basisvec{z}$ are the Cartesian basis vectors.
But since we are interested in what the observer sees,
we must transform this into the local spherical basis, i.e.~put
----
$$
  \vec{u} =
    u_r \basisvec{r} + u_\theta \basisvec{\theta} + u_\phi \basisvec{\phi},
$$
----
where
  $\basisvec{r}$ points up~(上),
  $\basisvec{\theta}$ points south~(南), and
  $\basisvec{\phi}$ points east~(東).

                -\sin D &            \cos D &  0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \cos Y \\ \cos\tau \sin Y \\ \sin\tau \sin Y
    \end{pmatrix}.
  \end{aligned}
$$

----
This looks rather horrible.
To simplify it, I define what I call the
__tilt-reduced unit radius__ and the __tilt-reduced year angle__,
----
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \rho &= \sqrt{\cos^2 Y + \cos^2\tau \sin^2 Y} \\
    \varphi &= \tan^{-1} \frac{\cos\tau \sin Y}{\cos Y},
  \end{aligned}
$$
----
where $\tan^{-1} (y/x)$ is an abuse of notation
meaning $\mathrm{atan2} (y, x)$
(in other words $\varphi$ is always in the same quadrant as $Y$).

----
Let us ponder these for a moment.
Since $Y$ is constant over the course of a day,
so are $\rho$ and $\varphi$.
Thus the components are sinusoidal in $D$,
with a period of one (solar) day.
Since $\cos\delta$ is nonnegative,
the upward component $u_r$ is maximised at $D = \varphi$.
I would wager (but can't be bothered showing)
that the sun's angle of elevation
$\tan^{-1} (u_r / \sqrt{{u_\theta}^2 + {u_\phi}^2})$
is also maximised at $D = \varphi$,
corresponding to __solar noon__ (or __high noon__).
This makes perfect sense; notice that the eastward component
$u_\phi$ is zero and decreasing   at $D = \varphi$,
i.e.~the sun is crossing the local meridian (north-south arc of the sky)
towards the west.
(Similarly we have solar midnight at $D = \varphi + \pi$,
when the sun is closest to the nadir, the local downward direction.)
----

----
__Note.__ Solar noon (or high noon) almost never occurs at 12~pm.
There are several reasons for this:
----
++++
1. __Earth's axial tilt.__ \+
  This has been accounted for by our model;
  notice that solar noon occurs at $D = \varphi$
  rather than $D = Y$.

2. __Earth's orbit is elliptical, not circular.__ \+
  The sun moves faster and slower at different times of the year.

3. __Time zones.__ \+
  Clock time jumps discontinuously over their boundaries (which are arbitrary),
  whereas local solar time is a smooth function of location.

__Sunrise__ and __sunset__ occur
when the sun passes through the horizon,

  \right],

----
where $D = D_-$ corresponds to sunrise, and $D = D_+$ to sunset.
(Noon, $D = \varphi$, is halfway between the two.)
The day angle which elapses between sunrise and sunset is therefore
----
$$
  D_+ - D_- =
  \pi + 2 \sin^{-1} \bigbr{\tan\tau \tan\delta \sin\varphi}.

----
Multiplying this by $\unit{day} / (2 \pi)$
gives the amount of time between sunrise and sunset,

  T =

----
__Note.__ The argument to the arcsine will exceed unity in magnitude
at some time during the year if $\abs{\tan\tau \tan\delta} > 1$, or
----
$$
  \abs{\delta} > \frac{\pi}{2} - \tau.
$$

----
In such a case there is no real solution to the sunrise/sunset equation.
This corresponds to midnight sun~(24~hr daylight)
and polar night~(24~hr darkness), which occur for observers
north of the Arctic Circle and south of the Antarctic Circle
(give or take due to refraction).

The errors are just over 1%;
not bad for something derived with pen and paper.
----

----
Nevertheless our model underestimates daytime by around 10 minutes.
The weakest assumptions in our model are
the ignoring of atmospheric refraction
and the treating of the sun as a point.
Because light bends through the atmosphere,
the sun is visible even though it is slightly below the horizon.
Also sunrise/sunset occur when the leading/trailing edge of the sun passes
through the horizon, rather than its centre.
----

----
According to [this Hong Kong Observatory article by Tong Yu-fai](
  https://www.hko.gov.hk/m/article_e.htm?title=ele_00493
  Effect of atmospheric refraction on the times of sunrise and sunset
)
(which the Wayback Machine could not save at the time of writing),
refraction contributes around 0°34' of angular discrepancy, and
the apparent radius of the sun, 0°16', so that altogether,
the sun is 0°50' below the horizon at sunrise/sunset.
----

----
<small>
These figures appear to have been pulled off [Wikipedia][refraction],
which is possibly(?) referring to [p.~125][allen 125]
  (<var>z</var><sub>a</sub> = 90.0°, <var>z</var><sub>t</sub> = 90°35',
  i.e.~refraction of 0°35' at the horizon)
and [p.~162][allen 162]
  (semi-diameter of sun at mean earth distance = 959.63", i.e.~0°16')
of Allen's '''Astrophysical Quantities''' (1973).
In any case I think the final angle of 0°50' is reliable;
[this Hong Kong Observatory document] [hko pdf]
([archived version] [hko pdf archived])
uses it for computing sunrise/sunset times.

A correction to daytime which accounts for refraction and
the sun's apparent radius can be obtained by seeking the times at which the
sun's altitude $\alpha$ dips to
----
$$
  \alpha = -\alpha_\mathrm{ref},
$$
----
where $\alpha_\mathrm{ref} = 0\degree \, 50'$.
Presumably these times will not be far from the approximate sunrise/sunset
times we have already calculated, so we seek $\eps_\pm$ such that

$$
  \left.
    \tan^{-1} \frac{U}{\sqrt{S^2 + E^2}}
  \right|_{D = D_\pm + \eps_\pm}

Assuming $\eps_\pm \ll 2 \pi$, we obtain (to first order)
----
$$
  \eps_\pm =
  \pm \frac{
    \tan\alpha_\mathrm{ref} \sqrt{1 + \tan^2\tau \sin^2\varphi}
  }{
    \cos\delta \sqrt{1 - \tan^2\tau \tan^2\delta \sin^2\varphi}
  }
$$
----
so that the amount of daytime is to be corrected by
----
$$
  \frac{\eps_+ - \eps_-}{2 \pi} \unit{day} =
  \frac{

For the 7~July example above, this evaluates to
+8~minutes for Hong Kong and +9~minutes for Perth,
and in both cases
the [modc/ refraction-corrected model /] is able to predict daytime

----
With the exception of Enderby Land, the model does quite well;
the correction brings daytimes to within 0.5%,
and sunrise/sunset bearings to within 1°.
The model performs poorly for Enderby Land because polar night has
recently ended on 26~June (just 11~days earlier),
so the sun is spending a rather large proportion of the day near the horizon
(where refraction is significant); the correction for Enderby Land
actually makes things worse
(I think this is because the associated value of $\abs{\eps_\pm} = 0.46$
is not small enough for the perturbation to work properly).
----

----
Note that the refraction correction is a first-order perturbation about
the no-refraction sunrise and sunset times, and as such it cannot predict
the early start and late end of midnight sun,
nor the late start and early end of polar night,
compared to a hypothetical Earth with no atmosphere.
