##{#conways-preface} Conway's Preface

--
.《論語》, ".[The] Analects", colloquially known as "Confucius Say",
is a collection of (alleged) sayings of Confucius and others.
Though not initially of exceeding prominence,
it eventually became a central text of Confucianism.
A detailed discussion about its history, authorship, and significance
I defer to [its Wikipedia article].
--
--
The ''Analects'' have been interpreted to death throughout the ages,
[as pointed out by James Legge].
Scholars have written countless .註 "annotations" and .疏 "subcommentary"
(which are annotations of the annotations).
It is of course a slippery slope
between critical interpretation of a text (exegesis)
and projection of the interpreter's viewpoint into it (eisegesis).
--
--
This translation is an attempt to render the ''Analects''
with as few supplied words as possible,
that it might keep nigh unto exegesis.
When it feels like the translation is vague or not saying very much,
this is a reflection of the terseness of the original Chinese.
